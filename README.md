# InstructGPT-Analogies



## Data

`std_davinci` has analogies generated by the Davinci model for STD concepts.

`saqa.txt` has Target, Source, and Explanation extracted from analogies in `saqa_full.txt`. Explanations were used for automatic evaulation for precision since they genereally contain the core part of the analogies, while the full analogies were used for human evaluation for clarity. Target and source is also present in `saqa_concepts.txt`.

`saqa_<model>` and `saqa_<model>_src` contain analogies generated by the MODEL for SAQA dataset concepts in the no_src and wsrc settings.

`amt_res` and `amt_src_res` contain the results of human evaluation of no_src and wsrc analogies.

`non_analogies` contains text generated by no_anlgy prompts.

## Code

`plm_generator.py` can be used to generate analogies. Prompt type, temperature, and model should be provided as command line arguments.
