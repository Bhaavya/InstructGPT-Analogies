The algorithm is designed to take a set of data points and find a signal using a least squares algorithm.	anova	How is anova like finding signal in the noise?
The thermostat is like the hypothalamus because it controls the body's temperature. The hypothalamus is located in the body and it helps to control the body's daily temperature.	thermostat	How is thermostat like hypothalamus?
Water levels in and around dams and lakes are typically measured in chemical equilibrium. This is the process where using a chemical to adjust the chemical's chemical structure so that it can exist as a single entity in a different material. This can be done by using a test kit that manufactures a specific chemical that will do this for you. Once the test is done, the chemical can be used to adjust the level of the chemical in the material.	chemical equilibrium	How is chemical equilibrium like water level in dam and lake?
Just-in-time is a term used in business and engineering to describe the process of making a product or service when it is already in use or ready to use. This is different from traditional manufacturing, where products are made in bulk or over a long period of time.	just-in-time	How is just-in-time like water and rocks?
Adaptive immunity is like police headquerters--it is a type of immunity that is developed over time, over a long period of time. It is a type of immunity that is learned by being used in the context of the environment in which we live.	adaptive immunity	How is adaptive immunity like police headquerters?
The law is like a cat, because it is a mathematical law that states that the total potential power of an energy is the sum of the power of the positive and negative sides of the equation.	ohm's law	How is ohm's law like cats, mice and cake?
The process of transcription is like that of photocopying a document. The process of transcription is the process of turning text into code. Code is a set of instructions that a computer understands and responds to. Transcription is the process of turning text into code. Transcription is the process of turning text into a machine.	transcription	How is transcription like photocopying?
The rna polymerase is like a virus that can change its structure and function. It is used to produce proteins in the rna cells in the body.	rna polymerase	How is rna polymerase like xerox machine?
Ribosome is like a cookbook because it contains the genetic instructions for creating all the proteins in a living cell.	ribosome	How is ribosome like cook?
The activator protein is a molecule that is expressed in the body when a person is treated with a treatment that kills or reduces the activity of a let-7-hydroxylase. This treatment is called a " targer" in the body. The activator protein helps to reduce the activity of this enzyme so that the body can process the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the body.	activator protein	How is activator protein like bookmarks?
Electric circuits are like air flows through tubes. The pressure in one tube is greater than the pressure in another tube is greater than the pressure in the third tube is greater than the pressure in the fourth tube is greater than the pressure in the fifth tube is greater than the pressure in the sixth tube is greater than the pressure in the seventh tube is greater than the pressure in the eighth tube is greater than the pressure in the ninth tube is greater than the pressure in the tenth tube is greater than the pressure in the eleven tubes are greater than the pressure in the twelve tubes are greater than the pressure in the thirteen tubes are greater than the pressure in the fourteen tubes are greater than the pressure in the fifteen tubes are greater than the pressure in the sixteen tubes are greater than the pressure in the seventeen tubes are greater than the pressure in the eighteen tubes are greater than the pressure in the nineteen tubes are greater than the pressure in the twenty-one tubes are greater than the pressure in the twenty-two tubes are greater than the pressure in the twenty-three tubes are greater than the pressure in the twenty-four tubes are greater than the pressure in the twenty-five tubes are greater than the pressure in the twenty-six tubes are greater than the pressure in the twenty-seven tubes are greater than the pressure in the twenty-eight tubes are greater than the pressure in the twenty-nine tubes are greater than the pressure in the thirty-one tubes are greater than the pressure in the thirty-two tubes are greater than the pressure in the thirty-three tubes are greater than the pressure in the thirty-four tubes are greater than the pressure in the thirty-five tubes are greater than the pressure in the thirty-six tubes are greater than the pressure in the thirty-seven tubes are greater than the pressure in the thirty-eight tubes are greater than the pressure in the thirty-nine tubes are greater than the pressure in the forty-one tubes are greater than the pressure in the forty-two tubes are greater than the pressure in the forty-three tubes are greater than the pressure in the forty-four tubes are greater than the pressure in the forty-five tubes are greater than the pressure in the forty-six tubes are greater not the pressure in the forty-seven tubes are greater than the pressure in the forty-eight tubes are greater than the pressure in the forty-nine tubes are greater than the pressure in the forty-10What is the difference between electric and air-flow theory?The main difference between electric and air-flow theory is that electric circuits are created by and create energy by being connected to power systems, and air flows through tubes.	electric circuit	How is electric circuit like air flowing through a tube?
The electric circuit is like a rope through metal rings. The rings surrounding the metal are negative, and the charges in the metal are potential. The potential energy is held in the metal by the rings' negative charges. When there is an electric current through the rings, it flows through the rings into the metal and creates a current of power.	electric circuit	How is electric circuit like rope through metal rings?
The hydrophobic effect is like a teenager at a party. You are all excited and in a good mood, but someone just walked in and started making fun of you.	hydrophobic effect	How is hydrophobic effect like teenagers at a party?
The process of biological signal transduction is the process that allows cells to send or receive signals that can result in events like birth defects or growth.	biological signal transduction	How is biological signal transduction like threat communication in animals?
