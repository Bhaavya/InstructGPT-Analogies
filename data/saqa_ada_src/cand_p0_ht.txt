These families have pairs of flowers on a stem where each blossom contains two eggs.	column chromatography	Explain column chromatography using an analogy involving separating bees and wasps.
Bees and wasps are both animals that can be chromatographed using the same material. The difference is that bees can be spotted, while wasps cannot.	column chromatography	Explain column chromatography using an analogy involving separating bees and wasps.
 Chromatography is a process of sisters named "elimination" and "separation". You can think about it like using the natural maximizing of your resources - here, you eliminate most if not all of the lessedy options in an effort to get to the desired item. Eg: Bees and wasps differ in that bees produce pollen while wasps consume pollen. However, they also have pretty much everyone else on their albatross-like list: Bangladesch has more than 10 million waspmales, but we only have 650 single solitary honeybees. We could senilely put these two groups together and say that wasp Y027 is much smarter than bee Y027T, but you don't want to create too many Commitment Questions with meaningless values.	column chromatography	Explain column chromatography using an analogy involving separating bees and wasps.
