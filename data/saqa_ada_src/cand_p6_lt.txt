The anti-stokes scattering is also similar to the scattering of balls by hitting a plate because it is a process of scatter across the surface of the plate.	anti-stokes scattering	How is anti-stokes scattering similar to ball striking a plate?
The ball and stokes scattering are similar because the plate is an ideal surface.	stokes scattering	How is stokes scattering similar to ball striking a plate?
The lethal dose of a substance is similar to the force with which it is delivered.	median lethal dose	How is median lethal dose similar to balls and target?
The universe is similar to the surface of a balloon because the two are areas that are made up of particles and waves.	universe	How is universe similar to surface of a balloon?
The lock and key mechanisms are similar. The difference is that the lock key is able to open the door, while the key cannot.	enzyme mechanism	How is enzyme mechanism similar to lock and key?
Anova is similar to finding signal in the noise in that it is a way to identify which part of a data set is important. Anova is also similar to finding a needle in a haystack in that it can be used to find specific information within the data.	anova	How is anova similar to finding signal in the noise?
The two most important structures in the body are the hypothalamus and the thermostat. The hypothalamus is responsible for the body's temperature, while the thermostat regulates the environment around the body.	thermostat	How is thermostat similar to hypothalamus?
Chemical equilibrium is similar to water level in dam and lake in that water levels are a product of precipitation, flooding, and runoff. When water levels in a dam or lake are compared to other places (like without any water), it is considered chemical equilibrium.	chemical equilibrium	How is chemical equilibrium similar to water level in dam and lake?
Just-in-time is a technique used in business and technology to optimize performance. It is the technique of moments before and after an action. It is also used to describe a technique used in advertising.Water and rocks are two examples of materials. Material is a word that describe the relationship between two items, like water and rocks. Material is a word that describes the relationship between two items, like water and rocks.	just-in-time	How is just-in-time similar to water and rocks?
Adaptive immunity is similar to police headquerters, which is the practice of looking around for people who are law enforcement officers. It is similar in that both people and machines need to adapt to the new environment in order to stay safe and safe enough for themselves and those around them.	adaptive immunity	How is adaptive immunity similar to police headquerters?
The law is similar to how cats, mice and cake move around. The difference is that cats have a "vowel" function in their vocal system and cake has a "vowel" function in its vocal system.	ohm's law	How is ohm's law similar to cats, mice and cake?
The process of transcription is similar to photocopying, except that transcription takes place in a lab and is financed by the government. In photocopying process, the paper is cut into small pieces and the each copy is printed out as it is written.	transcription	How is transcription similar to photocopying?
The rna polymerase is similar to the xerox machine, it is a enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction between DNA and lactic acid.	rna polymerase	How is rna polymerase similar to xerox machine?
Ribosome is similar to cook because they are both proteins that are used to control events in the life of a cell.	ribosome	How is ribosome similar to cook?
The activator protein is a molecule that is responsible foractivating the bookshelf in a bookshop. This molecule is responsible foractivating the bookshelf by stimulating the bookshelf-leveling cells in the brain.	activator protein	How is activator protein similar to bookmarks?
Electric circuits are similar to air flows through tubes because they are both through-going flows. The difference is that electric circuits flow through both the positive and negative ends of the material they are built on, whereas air flows only through the positive end.	electric circuit	How is electric circuit similar to air flowing through a tube?
Electric circuits are similar to ropes through metal rings in that they are both used to power a device or system. The difference between electric and rope through metal rings is that electric circuits are used to power a device or system by pulling energy from the rings around the device or system, while rope through metal rings use a pulling force to power the device or system.	electric circuit	How is electric circuit similar to rope through metal rings?
The hydrophobic effect is similar to how teenagers at a party would feel at a party. They would be excited and have fun.	hydrophobic effect	How is hydrophobic effect similar to teenagers at a party?
In animals, threat communication is typically done through movement, behavior, and eggs, which are constantly exposed to risk. Biological signals are created and received through contact with others in the population. They are created when a unit in the population becomes aware of a potential threat and act to avoid it.	biological signal transduction	How is biological signal transduction similar to threat communication in animals?
