The analogy allows us to understand how the different models can be used to calculate the lethal dose of a substance.	median lethal dose	How is median lethal dose analogous to balls and target?
The universe analogy is a way of thinking about the way the surface of a balloon feels. The analogy suggests that the universe is a comfortable, soft, small space, and that the surface of the balloon is like a perfect, hard, small space.	universe	How is universe analogous to surface of a balloon?
The lock and key analogy is that enzymes are locks, with the key allowing access within the locked area. The mechanism of enzymes is also like a key, with the key allowing access to the enzyme from within the lock.	enzyme mechanism	How is enzyme mechanism analogous to lock and key?
Anova is analogous to finding a signal in the noise. It is a way to measure the strength of a signal.	anova	How is anova analogous to finding signal in the noise?
Thermostat analogy is like the hypothalamus in that it is a body part that controls the temperature in the home. The temperature in the home is controlled by the temperature at the top of the hypothalamus.	thermostat	How is thermostat analogous to hypothalamus?
Chemical equilibrium is the process of creating and maintaining a chemical equilibrium. In chemical equilibrium, all molecules of a chemical are in the same state. The level of a chemical in a water body is the amount of that chemical that is in every molecule of water.	chemical equilibrium	How is chemical equilibrium analogous to water level in dam and lake?
Just-in-time is a technique used in business and technology to automate the process of creating and managing deadlines. It is the equivalent of how a plant uses time-of-use rates to schedule products in advance.	just-in-time	How is just-in-time analogous to water and rocks?
Adaptive immunity is analogous to police headquerters, who are looking for potential threats to the community. The purpose of this type of immunity is to help us identify and deal with potential threats so that the community is not left vulnerable.	adaptive immunity	How is adaptive immunity analogous to police headquerters?
The analogy to cake is that cats are made of cheese. The analogy to mice is that they are both creatures of habit. and the analogy to ohm's law is that it is a way of keeping track of energy.	ohm's law	How is ohm's law analogous to cats, mice and cake?
The process of transcription is similar to photocopying: the text is cut off, cut-and-paste from a text editor, and then it is copied into a text document.	transcription	How is transcription analogous to photocopying?
The rna polymerase is similar to the xerox machine, it is a machine that synthesizes RNA molecules.	rna polymerase	How is rna polymerase analogous to xerox machine?
Ribosome analogy is the process of similarities between a molecule's sequence and a cook's arm.	ribosome	How is ribosome analogous to cook?
The activator protein is a molecule that helps with protein expression in cells. It is responsible for giving the protein called DNA synthesis going forward. The activator protein is also responsible for translating the DNA into the protein called RNA.	activator protein	How is activator protein analogous to bookmarks?
Electric circuits are analogous to air flows in tubes. The difference is that electric circuits are created and enjoyed by consumers and businesses, while air flows are enjoyed by consumers and plants.	electric circuit	How is electric circuit analogous to air flowing through a tube?
Electric circuits are analogous to ropes through metal rings, because they are long and thin pieces of metal that can be pulled through a opening.	electric circuit	How is electric circuit analogous to rope through metal rings?
The analogy is that people are at a party and water is being given as a drink. The teenager at the party is hydrophobic and will not drink the water given to them.	hydrophobic effect	How is hydrophobic effect analogous to teenagers at a party?
The analogy between biological signal transduction and threat communication is that biological signals can be used to communicate challenges and opportunities, while animals use their signals to communicate challenges and information.	biological signal transduction	How is biological signal transduction analogous to threat communication in animals?
