Adaptive immunity is a term used to describe the process of how our immune system responds to new challenges and infections. The immune system responds by adapting and expanding its range of potential attacks. This is often done through a process called " adaptive evolution ." In some cases, this adaptation comes about due to the way the infection is packaged and/or the way the infection is received. In other cases, the infection is caused by a problem with the environment or the source of the infection. The immune system will work to address this issue and will work to create a better environment for the infection to grow.	adaptive immunity	Explain adaptive immunity using an analogy involving police headquerters.
