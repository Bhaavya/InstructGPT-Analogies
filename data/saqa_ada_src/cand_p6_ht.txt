Darnajanjit Patel, a professor in the Department of Genetics at University of Utah who has been studying photocopiers since the early 1990s, says that it's " pretty much the same thing as before: You go from taking a image of [the] cell you want to copied, to getting the image on top of what you have."He continues "When two papers are combined, about 60% of the mixture will be enough to form a adsorbed material. When two sheets of paper areCopied together, for instance by rolling them over), almost all of the mixture will be used up.
