Once you figure out how to do things with this product, most of the time there are specific steps that need to be followed in order for it to work. However, occasionally something funky might happen and sometimes people don't quite understand what they're doing - which is where dna comes into play. Dna is essentially like manufacturing Instructions and can help explain certain aspects of a situation more clearly.	dna	Explain dna using an analogy involving manufacturing instructions.
Instructions for making a piece of metal can be likened to the steps in manufacturing a car. The first step is chopping the materials together, by hand or with a machine. Next, they are heat-treated to make them tougher and more durable. Finally, they are shaped into their final form using tools and other processing techniques. The same goes for DNA: First, it is chopped up into small pieces like metal chopsticks (or rice). Then, it is heated so that its molecules rearrange themselves in new positions (like baking dough). This creates an immense amount of genetic variability; every individual’s unique genome is made up of billions ofizzle instructions!	dna	Explain dna using an analogy involving manufacturing instructions.
When you print out a manufacturing instruction booklet, there are all sorts of pages. Each page has specific instructions on how to make the product.

A Peroxisome is a waste disposal system that, when properly functioning, allows for the recycling of expended energy products. This analogy would be like getting pizza delivered to your house- you pay for it in advance and someone else then delivers it to your door. The deliverer-the peroxisome-uses discarded material (or energy) from previous meal orders as fuel to create new order compositions which can be further composted or even burned off completely depending on their operational conditions.	peroxisomes	Explain peroxisomes using an analogy involving garbage delivery system.
One analogy to explain peroxisomes is that they are like the garbage delivery system in a household. When one person leaves their room and doesn't bring a trash can with them, the rest of the house clears out and all of the waste goes into the common large garbage can. This is also how our bodies work- when one person stops leaving food for themselves or taking these necessary steps, other people have to take over what they're doing and deal with whatever messes up from there. The same thing happens with our body's cells- once one person isn't leading by example, other people may try to do too much at once and create mountains of destruction instead of cleaning it up properly.	peroxisomes	Explain peroxisomes using an analogy involving garbage delivery system.
One analogy that can be used to explain the role of peroxisomes is to think of them as garbage trucks. When a garbage truck drives down a street, it pickups all the trash that is placed in different piles on each side of the road. The driver uses his or her vehicle's engine to rotate these individual trash piles so that they are collected into one large pile. This process is repeated until all the trash has been pickup and delivered to the dumpster. Similarly, when a peroxisome driving system collects antioxidants from food, it amphitheatres collect this material and turn it into metabolites (products).	peroxisomes	Explain peroxisomes using an analogy involving garbage delivery system.
Mitochondria are similar to restaurants. They have kitchens in the back where you can order food, and the servers bring it out to your table. The mitochondria inside of each plant or animal cells create energy by converting food into heat.	mitochondria	Explain mitochondria using an analogy involving restaurants.
A restaurant is like a battery. You put in your credit card, and when you want something, the restaurant charges your account. Then they give you what you ordered, minus any taxes and cents that may have been charge back to your bank account. The cycle of this business is always being renewal- payments are made based on average eating habits over a certain period of time- then new customers are brought in who add to the usualangrevenue by purchasing items from other menu items or drinks that come with it (ie., appetizers and main courses).	mitochondria	Explain mitochondria using an analogy involving restaurants.
Restaurants use culinary oil to cook food, which is then heated up and expelled through the vents in the ceiling.

Similarly, one needs to take care while working with mitochondria not to cause any damage or injury.	mitochondria	Explain mitochondria using an analogy involving electric station.
An electric station is like a battery. When you plug in your electric cord, the electricity goes into the wall outlet and comes out of the outlets in different places. The same thing happens with mitochondria- when you put food into your mouth it takes up some space in your stomach and intestines, but because Electricity helps to turn these things into energy for us to use every day, our bodies can also use this energy to create glucose from sugar and other environmental sources.	mitochondria	Explain mitochondria using an analogy involving electric station.
A mitochondria is like an electric station. Electricity comes in two forms: either AC or DC. When you plug a power cord into an electric station, the electricity goes from one coil to another and then to your devices.

When you consider the mitochondria in a power plant, you can imagine how these tiny creatures function. In a power plant, each miner (mitochondrion) creates energy by splitting water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen atoms. This process is called oxidative respiration. The word "power" comes from this: every X watt of electricity that comes out of the reactor actually produces Y watts of heat; so if we wanted to measure how much power our reactor was producing, we would subtract the thermal output from the electricity output to get our Watts-per-hundred-meter reading.	mitochondria	Explain mitochondria using an analogy involving power plant.

An analogy to describe atp would be to compare it to the way someone eats ready-to-eat food.  For example, if someone is hungry and wants something that tastes good, they might choose a piece of fresh fruit or an ice cream sandwich. Similarly, when an individual experiences an emotional outburst during sexual climax, their body may release oxytocin (a hormone) which results in pleasure being felt from eating or drinking something that has caffeine in it.	atp	Explain atp using an analogy involving ready to eat food.

A b-lymphocyte is like a police inspector. They are very important in fighting infection and can help to clean up the place where an infection has occurred.	b-lymphocytes	Explain b-lymphocytes using an analogy involving police inspector.
An analogy for b-lymphocytes can be found in the role of a police inspector. Police inspectors are responsible for monitoring and enforcing laws and regulations. They also play an important role in investigating crimes. In this analogy, lymphocytes represent the cells that make up the policing body.	b-lymphocytes	Explain b-lymphocytes using an analogy involving police inspector.
When a cytotoxic t-lymphocyte activity is high, the cell has an increased production of force. This increase in force causes the cell to interact more effectively with neighbouring cells and kill them.	cytotoxic t-lymphocytes	Explain cytotoxic t-lymphocytes using an analogy involving action force.
An analogy involving action force might be to think of cytotoxic t-lymphocytes as lance fighters. Lancing against an enemy can result in a successful hit, but if the opponent is too strong or fast for the lymphocyte to kill, then the cell may become injured and die. The same is true with cancer cells; by killing these cells, cytotoxic t-lymphocytes help protect other cells from becoming damaged or killed.	cytotoxic t-lymphocytes	Explain cytotoxic t-lymphocytes using an analogy involving action force.
An analogy involving action force would be to imagine a seesaw. T-lymphocytes, or cells that produce immunity, come in contact with other cells through theville and use their attack force (or cytotoxic ability) to Casualties They kill these cells by engulfing them so they don't spread infection.	cytotoxic t-lymphocytes	Explain cytotoxic t-lymphocytes using an analogy involving action force.
An analogy involving action force would be to think of cytotoxic t-lymphocytes as pads on a UFC fighter's body that help in the fight against cancer. WhenCELLSATE becomes activated by exposure to neoplastic cells, it creates an imbalance in the cell membrane which then leads to apoptosis (cell death). In contrast, when TNFα is applied, it causes proliferation of tumour cells and job security for volunteer workers who are exposed to carcinogens.	cytotoxic t-lymphocytes	Explain cytotoxic t-lymphocytes using an analogy involving action force.
The cytotoxic t-lymphocytes are like the ball and Chain Reaction in action. The action force is the (sticky) substance that causes a reaction. When you add something to the chain, it attracts other particles along the way and starts a chain reaction. This happens because antibodies form when t-cells encounter this substance, which then cause them to produce more antibody(s). These antibodies then bind to another molecule, creating yet another product that will start a chain reaction of its own.	cytotoxic t-lymphocytes	Explain cytotoxic t-lymphocytes using an analogy involving action force.
A bacteria may invade a country when the conditions are right. The bacteria can exist in an environment that is hostile to other organisms and be able to attach themselves to cells in the body of the person or animal who has acquired it. Once inside, the bacteria can reproduce quickly and create complex structures on their surface that allow them to evade detection by either humans or animals.	invasion of bacterias	Explain invasion of bacterias using an analogy involving colonial invasion in a country.
In 1928, British scientists Jack Smith and Gordon Welchman came up with the idea of accidentally introducing bacteria into a new environment. They were looking for an opportunity to study differences between "native" populations of some bacterial types while they were living in colonies on a shipyard property in Bermuda. But when they intentionally spread some type of E. coli bacterium onto the cloth surface of some lab rats, they realized that the animals did not resist infection as vigorously as wild rodents. This led them to believe that other creatures could be similarly infected if given enough time and space to grow numbers. And so, three years later, in 1932,Smith and Welchman started Diptera (a insects), which is what we call today: colonialism began!	invasion of bacterias	Explain invasion of bacterias using an analogy involving colonial invasion in a country.
When a country invites another culture, group of people or organization to live in and do business with them, they are doing so as an act of invaders. The foreign culture is considered the intruder because it is not following the customs and traditions that the original population established.	invasion of bacterias	Explain invasion of bacterias using an analogy involving colonial invasion in a country.
When a colony of bacteria invades another country, the invading group may find that it is surrounded by defenses put in place to keep other types of organisms from entering. The invaders may also be met with hostility from the local population, since they are not wanted in their own land. In order for the invaders to survive and spread their genes inside the new country, they will likely have to interact with the locals on a regular basis.	invasion of bacterias	Explain invasion of bacterias using an analogy involving colonial invasion in a country.
When I was in college, I took a course on world history. In it, we learned about colonialism and the spread of diseases. We did an exercise where we had to compare different colonial strategies and what led to their success or failure. One example is the British conquest of Zealand in 1846-48. The British were very successful at invading other countries because they knew how to use diseases as a tool for Conquest. They also recruited local militarists who helped them fight the enemy while not getting involved in too much trouble themselves. This made sure that when they came back, they had already conquered all of their original territory which allowed them to focus on expanding into new territories	invasion of bacterias	Explain invasion of bacterias using an analogy involving colonial invasion in a country.
A group of workers assemble a piece of furniture by putting it together onepiece. The worker at the head of the line assembles first, followed by those in front of her, and finally the few behind her who are working simultaneously.	action potential	Explain action potential using an analogy involving assembly line.
A construction project typically has two stages: design and construction. In the first stage, designers create an initial plan for how the structure will be built. This is followed by the actual building of the structure. during this phase, workerscarry out the designer's plans and make changes as needed to make sure that everything fits together perfectly. Once all of the pieces are in place, it's then on to the construction phase, which involves putting all of these parts together and makingsure that they work well together.	action potential	Explain action potential using an analogy involving assembly line.
An assembly line is a path where products are put together and optimized to achieve the desired function. The analogy might be useful for explaining action potentials, which are short bursts of electrical energy that happen when cells send signals telling each other how much work they need done.	action potential	Explain action potential using an analogy involving assembly line.
When you are assembling a product, the assembly line is the same as the way that cells interact with one another in the body. The cells sense an environment (like blood flow) and produce molecules called messengers that travel to other cells and activate them to make moremessengers. This process continues until all of the products needed have been put together.	action potential	Explain action potential using an analogy involving assembly line.
In an assembly line, workers move objects along a conveyor belt. The object is put in a designated container and then the worker moves to the next step on the assembly line.	action potential	Explain action potential using an analogy involving assembly line.
Two cars might take a day trip if they drove to different destinations and then left them both at the same spot. Chromatography is similar to this analogy, where two columns of material are mixed together and then separated according to some property (e.g. size or weight) that affects how the mixture moves through each column.	experiment of chromatography	Explain experiment of chromatography using an analogy involving two cars taking a day trip.
A car can be seen as a collection of particles, each one moving independently. The same is true for chromatography - the particles in chromatography move along different channels to isolate the compounds they contain.	experiment of chromatography	Explain experiment of chromatography using an analogy involving two cars taking a day trip.
A car can be divided into two parts: the body and the chassis. The body is what you see outside, while the chassis is how it moves. This analogy helps to explain chromatography, which involves taking a sample from one part of a car and transporting it to another part so that different chemicals can be eliminated or combined according to their order of concentration.	experiment of chromatography	Explain experiment of chromatography using an analogy involving two cars taking a day trip.
When two cars take a day trip, one is driving and the other is sitting in the backseat. The driver of car A drives to their destination while the passenger inside car B listens to music from their phone. While car A is driving, the air pressure inside car B will be higher than outside of it due to the presence of more molecules of air within it. This high pressure situation will cause particles inCar A's interior to affect those same particles in Car B which then can be separated into smaller pieces according to how well they are able to flow through a chromatography column equipped with a Opera-like membrane	experiment of chromatography	Explain experiment of chromatography using an analogy involving two cars taking a day trip.
A car has a [floor] ofcciometers and includes a chromatography column. A sample is first put into the bottom of the chromatography column and then passed through to the top. The samples are then combined and sent back down the column where they are further processed by bubbling them with water or by adding organic solvents.	experiment of chromatography	Explain experiment of chromatography using an analogy involving two cars taking a day trip.
The main-sequence lifetime of a star is the time it takes for its core to fusion billions of times and turn into an orange gas. This process happens about 10 million years. Next, the stars’ outer layers start to form and they can live between 20 and 100 million years before dying in a spectacular explosion called an “explosion cataclysm.”	main-sequence lifetimes of stars	Explain main-sequence lifetimes of stars using an analogy involving how long a car can run.
A star's main-sequence lifetime is the time it will remain in the same particular stage of its life – called a "main sequence." This means that this period of their lives is relatively short: typically around 100 million years. The stars come into contact with interstellar gas and dust during their early stages, which can cause them to evolve fainter or disappear altogether.	main-sequence lifetimes of stars	Explain main-sequence lifetimes of stars using an analogy involving how long a car can run.
Every star has a main-sequence lifetime that is determined by its temperature and mass. The hotter the star, the longer it will stay in this state. The moreMass a star has, the shorter its main-sequence lifetime will be.	main-sequence lifetimes of stars	Explain main-sequence lifetimes of stars using an analogy involving how long a car can run.
A car can run for a certain amount of time, but it eventually runs out of fuel and dies. A star's main-sequence lifespan is much longer than a car's, because stars areatancially more complex and have many more variables that affect their lifetimes. For example, one variable that affects the length of a star's main-sequence life is how often its sun assembly line operate. If the assembly line operates frequently, then the star will keep going strong for longer; however if the assembly line operates infrequently then the star will die sooner.	main-sequence lifetimes of stars	Explain main-sequence lifetimes of stars using an analogy involving how long a car can run.
A typical main-sequence star, like the sun, has a life expectancy of about 100 million years. Over time, this star's outer envelope will start to erosion and detach from its core. The gas and dust within the core will be heated up by the star's nuclear reactions and fall out into space as a nebula. eventually they'll collide with another object in what is known as a supernova eruption.	main-sequence lifetimes of stars	Explain main-sequence lifetimes of stars using an analogy involving how long a car can run.

Every part of the cytosol has a job to do, and when one part becomes overwhelmed or inefficient, other parts can take over and complete their tasks better. The same is true for cells: When one part of a cell fails, others may succeed to take over as best they can.	cytosol	Explain cytosol using an analogy involving staff.
When you walk into a room, the first thing you notice is the furniture. The walls and desks are all different colors and styles, and there may be a few plants or paintings in some areas but for the most part it looks like one big open space. Then you look around at the people milling about, their conversations filling up every corner of your hearing radius until finally, as if by magic, you spot someone sitting behind you on a chair - that person's desk is right next to yours! This is what cytosol looks like: everything around us exists in this same open space - we can see everyone and everything but no one ever really interacts with each other face-to-face.	cytosol	Explain cytosol using an analogy involving staff.
The cytosol is the secretions of cells in the body. It is made up of two types of molecules: proteins and DNA. The proteins are small, organized into bundles, and responsible for most cellular activities. The DNA is a long string that helps to control how genes are expressed in different cells.	cytosol	Explain cytosol using an analogy involving staff.

In cell, each person produces their own little piece of the puzzle and must work together to complete the whole goal.	cell	Explain cell using an analogy involving factory.
When you go to a factory, the first thing you see is all of the machines. The machines are responsible for producing everything that we use in our everyday lives. There are different types of machines at different factories, depending on what type of product or service they’re producing. For example, a machine called a lathe can produce intricate details with high resolution using 360 degrees turns per minute. This kind of machine is used in non-traditional industries like sculpture and engineering where enthusiasts create things with precision and accuracy that would otherwise be too difficult or impossible to achieve without it.	cell	Explain cell using an analogy involving factory.

When you fill up your tank with gasoline, for example, the gas goes into the vesicles in your fuel cell and you get power from the photosynthesis process that takes place within each vesicle.	vesicles	Explain vesicles using an analogy involving transportation facility.
A vesicle is like a transportation facility. It can hold great quantities of an object, but it also has a limited supply. A transportacle can hold many objects at once, but it only has a certain amount of space for them. Vesicles are just the same- they have some limitations on how much they can hold and how quickly they can process information.	vesicles	Explain vesicles using an analogy involving transportation facility.

This analogy can be used to describe how cells work together in our body - they are like bank accounts, with different parts contributing money to help us achieve our goals.	cells	Explain cells using an analogy involving restaurant.
A restaurant is like a cell phone. When someone calls, the cells in their head send out signals to people around them telling them what to do. The same process happens when you make a call, and the person on the other end gets an idea of what you're saying (or maybe they don't even have to hear it) because their brain sends encrypted messages directly to your ears.	cells	Explain cells using an analogy involving restaurant.
Cell membrane is the protective outer layer of cells that separates them from their environment. It contains chemical substances and proteins that help keep cells alive and healthy.	cell membrane	Explain cell membrane using an analogy involving restaurant doors.
Cell membrane is like a restaurant door. When you walk in, the door opens automatically and your hand goes through an opening.

A window is like a cell membrane. When you look out the window, you see the world around you. But when you open your door and step outside, all of that information is hidden from view. The same thing happens with a cell: when we look at it through its cell membrane, we see only a small slice of what's going on inside the cell. However, when we think about how cells work, everything that's happening in a living organism— including the things we see on our streets and in our laboratories—Is happening within these tiny windows called pores.	cell membrane	Explain cell membrane using an analogy involving windows.

A capacitor is like a metal can filled with air. When you press the button on your watch, the air inside the can gets compressed (altered pressure). Because capacitors have an area of storage for energy, when you push in more air than they already contain, it "pushes" against the back side of the cap and increases its heat content.	capacitance	Explain capacitance using an analogy involving heat content.
A capacitor is like a metal container filled with air. When you touch the inside of the capacitor, it feels hot because of the heat from your hand. The same is true for when you put something in and pull out the cap. The outside world sees only what has already been put in- no new information has arrived.	capacitance	Explain capacitance using an analogy involving heat content.
The capacitance of a metal is the measure of how much heat energy is stored in it. When an electric current flows through a metal, some of the electricity (high Voltage) flows into the metal and causes it to heated up (added Heat). Some of the voltage goes away again but because there are more charges on one side than on the other, this creates an electrical field between these two sides which can persist for some time before dissipating back into air or natural light ( unless you have your x-ray machine handy ). The amount of heat that builds up inside a metal over time becomes known as its capacitance.	capacitance	Explain capacitance using an analogy involving heat content.
A capacitor consists of a material that can store an amount of energy and release it when the capacitor is activated. The heat content of a structure determines how much energy the capacitor can hold before releasing its stored energy. When you put your hand inside a cup with some hot air in it, even though your hand has very small contact area with the air, the heat from your hand melts the plastic around your fingers and warms up the air molecules in the cup. This process is called thermal expansion. Magnetism also follows this principle: when two materials are close together (as in magnetized lines), their electric fields cause them to expand until they reach equilibrium- where their original sizes have been restored. So too, capacitors work by expanding until they touch something else- like metal on one side or paper on another side whose resistance causes them to "touch" each other electrically).	capacitance	Explain capacitance using an analogy involving heat content.
A capacitor is like a heating pad. When you put your hand on it, the heat from your hand melts some of the plastic around it and spreads out. This liquid material kept within the cap has no resistance to flow (and so doesn't "thicken") until you take your hand away - which means that there's still some capacitance left in place! In terms of electrical measurements, capacitors are often measured in Farads (C).	capacitance	Explain capacitance using an analogy involving heat content.
Electric current flows through wires in a tank of water, like it does through wires in an electric cord. The difference is that the water in a tank has more surface area than wires, so currents flow faster and are stronger. Electric current also travels through pipelines and other cables as well, which makes them much thicker than water.	electric current	Explain electric current using an analogy involving water tank.
Electric current is like water in a tank. The water can be turned on and off by turning the faucet, just as you can turn electric current on and off by turning an electric appliance.	electric current	Explain electric current using an analogy involving water tank.
Electric current is like a water tank that stores energy. When you push the button on your electric kettle, you are doing the same thing as pushing the button on a water tank to refill it with new electricity. The only difference is that when you fill up your electric kettle, you're also filling up your Electrical Grid with electricity and this power can be used to perform tasks such as heating things or powering lights.	electric current	Explain electric current using an analogy involving water tank.
Electric current is like water in a tank. When you plug something into an electric outlet, the electricity flows through that object and to the power transformer inside the home. The transformers create a voltage difference between what's coming in from the devices plugged into your electrical outlet and what's going out. That difference creates enough force to turn turbines, which generate energy (based on how fast they run).	electric current	Explain electric current using an analogy involving water tank.
A electric current flowing through a wire is like water in a tank. The current's speed and amount are determined by the distance the wire is from other objects.	electric current	Explain electric current using an analogy involving water tank.
A staircase analogy can be used to explain voltage. Voltage is like the height of a person at the top of a stairs. It increases as you go up, and decreases as you descend.	voltage	Explain voltage using an analogy involving climbing a staircase.
A staircase has two sides, the top and bottom. The voltage on each side is the same: the higher side has more voltage than the lower side. The current running up and down a staircase is also increased because there are more steps on one side of the stairway than on the other (the "power" in electrical terms).	voltage	Explain voltage using an analogy involving climbing a staircase.
Volts are like steps, you need to be careful how much you weigh on each step. When you walk up the stairs, your muscles contract and create force. The same principle goes for electricity: you use more force when walking uphill because the incline is greater than in flat ground. The electric current running through a wire runs at a faster speed Downhill (this is why electric fences work), so it pulls energy down the wire towards the earth where it's converted into heat or light!	voltage	Explain voltage using an analogy involving climbing a staircase.
A staircase analogy helps to explain voltage. Voltage is the force that pushes objects up or down a stairs. The higher you climb, the more of this power your feet and hands use to push the object up the stairs. The same applies to electricity - it's like using energyusat as a tool to help move something around (like climbing a staircase).	voltage	Explain voltage using an analogy involving climbing a staircase.
You might think of voltage as the force that pulls things up the staircase. Voltage is what builds up in an electrical supply, and it's what helps to turn on lights and power appliances.	voltage	Explain voltage using an analogy involving climbing a staircase.
When a football player breaks through the line of scrimmage, they are charging towards their goal. The other team is trying to keep up and block them in order to allow the quarterback to throw the ball into the end zone. Communication between players is important in this sport, as it allows for easy passes and interceptions. Specific movements can be used by one player in order to create openings for another player on offense or defense. This type of communication is essential when playing against others who may try to():)	specialization and communication in a cell	Explain specialization and communication in a cell using an analogy involving football.
 specialization refers to the fact that different cells in an animal or plant have specific tasks assigned to them. Communication, on the other hand, is the exchange of information between cells.	specialization and communication in a cell	Explain specialization and communication in a cell using an analogy involving football.
In football, specialization is the process of choosing one skill set to focus on in order to succeed. This can be done through practice or by using a specific playbook. Communication is the ability for players to maintain communication with each other and understand what is happening on the field.	specialization and communication in a cell	Explain specialization and communication in a cell using an analogy involving football.
In football, a player is tagged with a position ( tackle, receiver, rusher) and they are responsible for getting the ball to their assigned person on time. This analogy can be used in understanding how specialization and communication play out in cells. A particular gene or protein that helps to make an individual's heart beat is not typically found elsewhere. The same holds true for genes related to speech or hearing. They may only be found here within the cell type that expressing them is necessary for proper function. If this specialization doesn't exist then it's difficult for thecellular machinery to do its job properly and eventually leading to failure or sickness as seen with deaf people who can't hear well because of problems associated with their ear structures	specialization and communication in a cell	Explain specialization and communication in a cell using an analogy involving football.
In football, specialization is the process of making sure that every player in a team can play at a high level. This means that players know their roles and are skilled in playing just one specific type of football game. Communication is essential for understanding what each player on the team is doing and how they should be played to win.	specialization and communication in a cell	Explain specialization and communication in a cell using an analogy involving football.
Aiker's Voltage = Grounded Loads x current	kirchoff's voltage law	Explain kirchoff's voltage law using an analogy involving hiking.
If you hike 10 miles and then lie down on the ground to rest, your body creates an electrical field around itself. If you have a voltagemeter next to your bed, it will read between 0 Volts (V) and 12 Volts (12 V). The higher number is above the ground or under the bed so when you stand up, Voltage goes from zero volts to 12 volts!	kirchoff's voltage law	Explain kirchoff's voltage law using an analogy involving hiking.
If you hike up a hill, your muscles will contract and push the air out of your lungs. This is what happens when youWalk Voltaire's law: If I increase my current by 1A, then Voltage (V) increases by 1 volt per ampere (1/Capacitance).	kirchoff's voltage law	Explain kirchoff's voltage law using an analogy involving hiking.
The voltage law states that the current in a wire is directly proportional to the square of the distance between the anode and battery.	kirchoff's voltage law	Explain kirchoff's voltage law using an analogy involving hiking.
A hiking analogy would be to think of voltage as weight. When you hike, you are putting weight behind your feet and the stronger pressure is pushing down on electricity in a conductor like a wire. The same happens with kirchoff's Voltage law: when current goes through something (like an electrical cable), it creates voltage between the two wires inside that thing.	kirchoff's voltage law	Explain kirchoff's voltage law using an analogy involving hiking.
A density wave is a type of waves that exist when objects meet each other. This can be seen in the form of traffic jams on highways, where the thicker objects create more resistance to movement and cause the cars to pile up higher and higher until they clear the obstruction.	nature of a density wave	Explain nature of a density wave using an analogy involving traffic jam on a highway.
Adensity waves are created when the pressure of people and objects in close proximity is too great. The high density of these waves causes them to form a thick layer on top of the water or air. This often leads to traffic jams because it can be difficult for cars, trucks, and other vehicles to pass through this mess.	nature of a density wave	Explain nature of a density wave using an analogy involving traffic jam on a highway.
A density wave is a type of wavesform that can be produced when several objects or people are trying to get in contact with each other at the same time. The density wave will form along the path of least resistance, which means it will be more likely to form where there isn't much else going on. This can cause navicular bones in someone's foot to collision because they'll try and walk around the pile of bodies instead of walking through it.	nature of a density wave	Explain nature of a density wave using an analogy involving traffic jam on a highway.
A density wave is like a traffic jam on a highway. It's really slow and it's all over the place. People are trying to get through, but it often feels impossible.	nature of a density wave	Explain nature of a density wave using an analogy involving traffic jam on a highway.
A density wave is like a traffic jam on a highway. The most obvious analogy is that density waves can exist when there's too much of something, and they can disappear when the amount of something decreases. Density waves are also created during earthquakes because people move around in search of materials (like earth)) at different densities.	nature of a density wave	Explain nature of a density wave using an analogy involving traffic jam on a highway.

The human Active Memory System rememberinformation by keeping track of recentevents and sharing those events with others.	human active memory system	Explain human active memory system using an analogy involving computer.
A computer has a memory, just like human brains. The memory is made up of binary numbers and each number can represent one of two things: the value it was at when last accessed (the address), or how many times that particular value has been visited in total (the frequency). When you walk around in your environment and touch something, your skin feels like a physical object with an identifier such as "touch 1" on the SurfacePro 4. That data is stored in special files on the computer where only you have permission to see it. I touched 1 again because I've recently walked past that location 10 times now and there were 5 touches from me between those visits so far. The device recognizes my touch even if all previous accesses were for different finger types - for example if I had three fingers instead of just one.	human active memory system	Explain human active memory system using an analogy involving computer.

The rate-determining step in a reaction is the process of finding out how quickly the reactants and products are moving. This can be done by measuring how much energy is being produced by each molecule during the reaction, or by using other methods to calculate the amount of time it will take for each molecule to move from one state to another.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Explain rate-determining step of a reaction using an analogy involving slowest moving car in traffic.
A reaction is slow because the process of chemical reactions happens over time. The rate at which a reaction happens tells you how fast the quantity of material is changing.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Explain rate-determining step of a reaction using an analogy involving slowest moving car in traffic.
A car in traffic is the fastest thing on the road. It's like a slowest moving object you can think of. The speed at which something moves determines how fast it can complete its task. In this analogy, scientists are measuring the rate at which light beam is traveling from one point to another in a reaction experiment - that is, the amount of time it takes for lightbeam to travel from one end of an experimental vessel to the other.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Explain rate-determining step of a reaction using an analogy involving slowest moving car in traffic.
A reaction is like a slow moving car in traffic. When you try to make your way between the cars, it's easy to get lost. The same is true for reactions: when you're trying to determine how fast something will happen, it's important not just to look at the clock or watch, but also to understand what factors are affecting the speed of each step in the process.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Explain rate-determining step of a reaction using an analogy involving slowest moving car in traffic.
The rate-determining step of a reaction is the slowest moving car in traffic. The goal of this step is to find the slogiest route for the fastest possible response.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Explain rate-determining step of a reaction using an analogy involving slowest moving car in traffic.
Bees and wasps collect pollen in their comb and then spread the pollen around on their thorax. This process of spreading pollen is called “column chromatography” because theyy use a column to separate the Pollen from the Water.	column chromatography	Explain column chromatography using an analogy involving separating bees and wasps.
Bees and wasps are two types of creatures that use column chromatography to separation substances.column chromatography is a process where the substances are placed in one layer on a glass or plastic surface and then forced through a small hole at the bottom of the column. The substances are then able to travel up the Column and be analyzed by using detectors on the side of the Column	column chromatography	Explain column chromatography using an analogy involving separating bees and wasps.
Bees and wasps are two types of animals that can be used toseparate different kinds of molecules.wasps clean the inside of their stings before using them to sting other creatures, while bees collect nectar from flowers. When you use a column chromatographymethod to separate these types of animals, the columns are lined with anoupler called a mobile phase, which consists of water, acetonitrile (CHCN), diethyl ether (DEA), and polar solvent such as benzene or xylene. The mobile phase is heated until it begins to boil over and this causes a change in pressure within the column. This change in pressure causesassociated compound molecules to break down into smaller pieces and they are then collected byators like needles that fall through the bottomof the column into another part of the lab where they will be analyzed for patterns	column chromatography	Explain column chromatography using an analogy involving separating bees and wasps.
Bees collect pollen and nectar in their stings, while wasps nest in tree parts. When you want to separate the pollen and nectar from these two types of materials, you need to do something like use a filter paper or an air-purifier to remove all the solid particles before allowing the liquid material to pass through.	column chromatography	Explain column chromatography using an analogy involving separating bees and wasps.
 Column chromatography is a type of analytical science that involves the separation of molecules using a material such as paper, plastic or glass. The object in the column is placed at one end and the molecules coming through the other end are sorted according to how closely they adhere to its surface.	column chromatography	Explain column chromatography using an analogy involving separating bees and wasps.
Two jugglers are trying to balance a large rock on their shoulders. If one of the jugglers falls off, the other must quickly catch him or her and keep the rock balanced. The same is true for liquid chemicals in equilibrium: if one substance increases (e.g., water turns into wine), then another substance decreases (salt becomes less salty).	dynamic chemical equilibrium	Explain dynamic chemical equilibrium using an analogy involving two jugglers.
 dynamic chemical equilibrium is like two jugglers. A juggler creates new balances and motions as they work, while the other person watches to see how things are going to balance out in the end. This same process happens in our bodies when we metabolize food and play with chemicals.	dynamic chemical equilibrium	Explain dynamic chemical equilibrium using an analogy involving two jugglers.
When two jugglers are juggling, they are constantly creating new combinations of balls and wands. In order for each ball to land in the appropriate hand it has to be placed in a specific position. In the same way, when there is equilibrium between different chemical molecules (sounds) it takes place when all of those molecules are at their final destination - collisions result in what appears to be an equal mix; both hands now have 10 pieces of candy.	dynamic chemical equilibrium	Explain dynamic chemical equilibrium using an analogy involving two jugglers.
 Dynamic equilibrium is the process by which two substances in a dynamic equilibrium are unable to move any closer or further apart. This happens because they have equal mass and when one substance has more of it, it can push the other away from its equilibrium position.	dynamic chemical equilibrium	Explain dynamic chemical equilibrium using an analogy involving two jugglers.
 Dynamic chemical equilibrium is the principle that states that when two chemicals are present in a balanced mixture, neither will overpower the other and result in an undesirable change. This is done by allowing each molecule of both chemicals to react at their own rate, which results in a stable balance.	dynamic chemical equilibrium	Explain dynamic chemical equilibrium using an analogy involving two jugglers.
A vacuum cleaner Integrity Exhaust Cleaner has a lot in it. Parts and pieces of many things are packed inside the bag- including dirt, dust, leaves, small rocks, plants and other objects that fall from the vacuum cleaner’s nozzle over time.	vacuole	Explain vacuole using an analogy involving storage bags.
A vacuole is like a storage bag. When you fill it with something, the vacuum pulls the air out of the bag and stores it in the vacuole. This helps to hold food or liquid inside the vacuole until it can be used.	vacuole	Explain vacuole using an analogy involving storage bags.
A storage bag is like a vacuole. When you put something into the storage bag, the vacuum builds up and eventually holds the item in there. This happens with all types of items- including foods! The same applies to your body- when we eat, our stomach creates empty space within itself which then creates a vacuum that sucks in food from inside our intestines and other areas.	vacuole	Explain vacuole using an analogy involving storage bags.
A vacuum cleaner sucks clean air out of a bag and into the room. In the same way, when your body cellsoid is cleaned, they are sucked into vacuole by the vacuum cleaner.	vacuole	Explain vacuole using an analogy involving storage bags.
A vacuum seal is like a storage bag. When you put something into the bottom of the storage bag, it becomes compressed. The same thing happens with a vacuole. By compressing the air in the vacuole, you can keep things inside.	vacuole	Explain vacuole using an analogy involving storage bags.
If you were to walk into a grocery store, you would see the shelves stocked with everything from food to cigarettes. Next to each item are two or more transport vesicles that can be delivered right there at the checkout. This is how transport buses and delivery trucks work: they deliver your groceries right where you need them.	transport vesicles	Explain transport vesicles using an analogy involving delivery truck.
A transport vesicle is a small, possibly solid delivery device that delivers medications or other substances to the body. The vesicles are often composed of lipid material and they rely on transferrin to carry molecules from one side of the cell to the other.	transport vesicles	Explain transport vesicles using an analogy involving delivery truck.
A transport vesicle is a small, round object that is used to deliver an item from one place to another. These objects can be delivered using different methods, including air or water. The most common way of delivering them is by using a delivery truck with a large container on the back that the vesicles are slid into.	transport vesicles	Explain transport vesicles using an analogy involving delivery truck.
A transport vesicle is like a delivery truck that brings food to your house. It has a large container on the back of it that you put in your refrigerator or cupboard and then push down with your hand. When the vesicles come into contact with something else, such as water or air, they burst open and release their contents.	transport vesicles	Explain transport vesicles using an analogy involving delivery truck.
Transportation vesicles are like delivery trucks. They carry things from one place to another, but they also have a lot of cargo inside them. The Cargo layer is made up of small molecules and ions (atomic particles) that contain the freight. The Aerodynamic Layer is made up of air pressure and temperatures which cause the truck to move forward or backward depending on its speed. Finally, the VanishingLayer takes away any gas or liquids that might be in contact with either side of the truck and it disappears into thin air	transport vesicles	Explain transport vesicles using an analogy involving delivery truck.
Proto-oncogenes are genes that have the potential to cause cancer. imagine if you had a car accelerator, it could turn your gas pedal to go faster when you press it. proto-oncogenes are like this, they can make sure that some cells in your body have the ability to grow and create tumors.	proto-oncogenes	Explain proto-oncogenes using an analogy involving car accelerator.
Prototypsis is when a new gene or protein is expressed in the body from an empty place. In cancer, proto-oncogenes are those genes or proteins that are found early in development and can help to cause tumors to form.	proto-oncogenes	Explain proto-oncogenes using an analogy involving car accelerator.
The proto-oncogene is like the pump that starts your car engine. When you turn the knob to get up energy, the proto-oncogene stores this energy and then uses it when needed to startengine.	proto-oncogenes	Explain proto-oncogenes using an analogy involving car accelerator.
Proto-oncogenes are genes that have not yet been fully expressed in a tissue or animal. They may be found near the start of an individual's genetic code, or they may be located more distant from it. Once a proto-oncogene is activated, it begins to promote the expression of other genes nearby.	proto-oncogenes	Explain proto-oncogenes using an analogy involving car accelerator.
Proto-oncogenes are proteins that causecancer. Car accelerator pedals increase the speed of a car, which can cause it to go faster than expected. The increased speed could potentially damage cells in the body, leading to cancer. proto-oncogenes are similar to accelerators, and they can help boost cancer cells into higher levels of activity so they can create more tumors.	proto-oncogenes	Explain proto-oncogenes using an analogy involving car accelerator.
Oncogenes are genes that control the expression of other genes. When a copy of an oncogene is mutated, it can increase the rate at which other genes become expressed. This increased production may lead to diseases such as cancer.	oncogenes	Explain oncogenes using an analogy involving car accelerator stuck in down position.
Oncogenes are proteins that can cause cancer. The analogy would be to say that the car accelerator is stuck in down position - meaning it's not allowing the engine to turn over.	oncogenes	Explain oncogenes using an analogy involving car accelerator stuck in down position.
Oncogenes are genes thatNormally control how cells divide and the type of cell they develop into. When these genes become mutated, this can lead to health problems. One example is a tumor gene that becomes activated when you eat processed foods rich in sugar or starch. Car accelerator stuck in down position is an analogy for this situation because if the car accelerator were stuck at its lowest setting, it would not be able to move forward as fast as if it was on high settings.	oncogenes	Explain oncogenes using an analogy involving car accelerator stuck in down position.
An analogy involving an accelerator stuck in the down position could be likened to a car having its accelerator pedal sticking out of the ground. If you try to move the pedal back up, it won't budge - just like when you have your accelerator stuck in thisDOWNposition.	oncogenes	Explain oncogenes using an analogy involving car accelerator stuck in down position.
An oncogene is a gene that contributes to the development of cancer.	oncogenes	Explain oncogenes using an analogy involving car accelerator stuck in down position.
Tumor suppressor genes are like car brakes. When you pull out of a parking spot, the brake pedal helps to keep your car from rolling away. The same is true for cancer: when we stop eating and Cancer cells become able to grow, they also get stopped from multiplying. By analogy, these suppression cassettes work by stopping cancer cells in their tracks.	tumor suppressor genes	Explain tumor suppressor genes using an analogy involving car brakes.
Tumor suppressor genes are like car brakes. When you stop the car, the brake pads grab onto the road and keep it from moving. The same is true for tumor suppressor genes. When we silenced these genes, our tumors stopped proliferating and started staying small – which is why they’re sometimes called “disabled” tumors.	tumor suppressor genes	Explain tumor suppressor genes using an analogy involving car brakes.
A car brake is a type of control system that helps the driver to stop a vehicle. The braking system includes drums or pads that are spread around the wheel in contact with the ground. When these systems are used, they help reduce movement and turn the wheel over so that you can apply power to it to keep your car from going into reverse. This type of system is important for safety because if someone was able to use their momentum to rotate the wheel too much and drive away, they could easily lose control and crash into something. Car brakes also have other uses – like when you step on pedals while driving so that your feet come down on metal filings instead of pavement which would cause an accident. All these different types of systems work together in order to make sure our cars stay stopped during stops and drives - just like tumors sometimes work Together!	tumor suppressor genes	Explain tumor suppressor genes using an analogy involving car brakes.
Tumor suppressors are genes that keep tumors from multiplying and spreading. When a tumor suppressor gene is turned off, the cancer can't grow very large or spread to other parts of the body.	tumor suppressor genes	Explain tumor suppressor genes using an analogy involving car brakes.
Tumor suppressor genes are like car brakes. When you get a parking ticket, the police can tell you that your car has broken down but they won’t say how much money you will have to pay. The same thing is true with tumor suppressor genes. They can help us know why some cancer cells get bigger and others don’t, but they also don’t give us information about all the cancers out there.	tumor suppressor genes	Explain tumor suppressor genes using an analogy involving car brakes.
A jenga game is similar to brittle software. When two pieces of the puzzle that make up a visible structure are broken, it creates chaos and makes it difficult for someone to put the pieces back together. The same is true with brittle software: when one piece goes missing, it makes life hard for everyone who depends on it.	brittle software	Explain brittle software using an analogy involving jenga.
If you take a jenga piece and put it on the top of another piece, then place them back in order (like so), the first two pieces are now at the bottom. If you try to move any of these pieces without paying attention to where they're going, they will eventually snap or break. This is how brittle software works too; when we try to do something with our software without taking into account what will happen if we don't, it can undermine our efforts altogether.	brittle software	Explain brittle software using an analogy involving jenga.
If you break a jenga piece, the pieces do not fall back together again. The same is true for software: if we break something, it doesn't automatically fix itself – we have to go and fix it ourselves. Like with a jenga game, our code just keeps on working but can be more susceptible to problems in the future.	brittle software	Explain brittle software using an analogy involving jenga.
A jenga game is like a brittle software product: pieces can fall out, and the whole structure can collapse. The same thing happens to brittle software products when they're used inocations or interactions that are not well-specified or defined.	brittle software	Explain brittle software using an analogy involving jenga.
If you were to take a jenga piece and place it on the ground, then destroy every other piece in front of it, it would be said that the software is brittle.	brittle software	Explain brittle software using an analogy involving jenga.
Rhinoceros are a type of animal that has two horns on their head. When they make an sound, the horns resonate and create a resonance. This can be heard when someone talks or sings because the hairs on their head vibrate in response to what they're saying.	resonance hybrid	Explain resonance hybrid using an analogy involving rhinoceros.
A resonance hybrid is a type of immunotherapy that uses cells from two different species to combination in order to produce an immune response.	resonance hybrid	Explain resonance hybrid using an analogy involving rhinoceros.
There is a feeling of resonance when two or more things are connected in some way. In the case of the rhinoceros, this might be through their horns or other physical features. Thislinkedness can be felt as an intuitive sense that something is related to orfits together with another item in a particular way.	resonance hybrid	Explain resonance hybrid using an analogy involving rhinoceros.
Rhinoceros are interesting for their horns, which can be used to control carriages or other animals. They also have a very large nasal cavity and strong hearing abilities. This makes them perfect creatures for Resonance hybrid development because they share many of the same traits as humans, but with the added ability to communicate through sound.	resonance hybrid	Explain resonance hybrid using an analogy involving rhinoceros.
Rhinoceros is a very large and powerful animal, but it also has a huge horn. When two or more animals are together, the horns of one of them can create an effective sonic boom. This happens because when waves from both the creature's horns and their egos collide, they form an acoustic wave that is larger than either its own sound or any other individualSound. Resonance hybrid occurs when two different types of sounds merge to form what seems like one louder noise (anechoic).	resonance hybrid	Explain resonance hybrid using an analogy involving rhinoceros.
A firefly is a type of light that owes its brightness to thedemocracy of its photons. A wave is like a rubber band, and when you stretch it, the waves inside it follow suit — just as if you had attached some water droplets to each end of an elastic band and then pulled them tight. Likewise, when you make contact with something, whether with your hand or a hard object such as a door handle, waves are created between your skin and whatever you're encountering.	wave mechanical model	Explain wave mechanical model using an analogy involving firefly in a dark room.
If you close your eyes and focus on a firefly, it will be easy to see them in the dark room. The same is true for waves; if you focus on one of these things, they'll be easy to see. With wave models, like with fireflies or waves, the more you concentrate on one thing, the more accurate this model becomes.	wave mechanical model	Explain wave mechanical model using an analogy involving firefly in a dark room.
The model of a wave is like a firefly in the dark room. The firefly has movement because it is fueled by electricity and gas. A wave, too, has movement because of the motion of waves. However, instead of being fueled by electricity and gas, waves are powered by sound. When you listen to a song on your radio or watch a movie, both cases involve wave models as well.	wave mechanical model	Explain wave mechanical model using an analogy involving firefly in a dark room.
When you see a firefly in the dark, it is easy to imagine how waves look like when they travel through the air. The light from the firefly bounces off of things such as surfaces and molecules in the atmosphere, and this creates an oscillating current that can be seen even without looking. This is what happens with wave mechanical models: similar fluctuations are created when particles move around in a fluid or gas, which is why these fluids and gases often have waves-like behavior too.	wave mechanical model	Explain wave mechanical model using an analogy involving firefly in a dark room.
A wave is like a firefly in a dark room. They are all tiny, flitting creatures that navigate their way through the water using the guiding light of their flame. A firefly's central filament is what they use to navigate and they can change direction depending on where the light hits them. Waves work just as well - if you set up your defences against them (like putting something between yourself and a wave), then you can protect yourself from getting hurt or killed by one.	wave mechanical model	Explain wave mechanical model using an analogy involving firefly in a dark room.
A person's electroencephalogram (EEG) shows the patterns of electrical impulses that stream through their brain. These impulses can be recorded and analyzed to reveal how a person is feeling. For example, if you listen to someone talk on the phone, you'll hear sound waves traveling in all directions as the person talks. The same thing happens when people speak - each word gets sent out with an coursing current of electricity.	electroencephalogram	Explain electroencephalogram using an analogy involving listening to a game.
A electroencephalogram (EEG) is a recording of the electrical activity in the brain. It can be used to measure how often different parts of the brain are active.	electroencephalogram	Explain electroencephalogram using an analogy involving listening to a game.
Electroencephalograms (EEG) are like listening to games. When you listen to a game, the sound waves that hit your eardrums are Traveling Waves (or Multifrequency bands). These waves can be explained in terms of time and motion. The first thing that happens when you hear a game is that your brain hears an electric current running through it- something called an impulse train. This current varies in its speed as it travels across your scalp. It also changes in amplitude, or strength, as it moves down your spine and around your head. Since our brains are constituen tly adapted to processing high levels of electrical activity thisCurrent createsand receives vibrations which can be heard as sounds by us humans !  ear impressions make up about 95%of all what we record on our EGG but each individualbrain records over 10 different channels which gives rise to a total waveform .	electroencephalogram	Explain electroencephalogram using an analogy involving listening to a game.
Your brain is like a audio amplifier. When you listen to a game, the sound waves that flow through your head create an electroencephalogram (EEG). The patterns of electrical activity in your brain are similar to those seen on an EEG during a gaming experience.	electroencephalogram	Explain electroencephalogram using an analogy involving listening to a game.
An electroencephalogram is like a record of brain waves. When you listen to the music on an audio cd, the soundwave goes through your head and tracks along with the beat. The same thing happens when you hear the sounds of your own movements as they happen in reality. Your ears pick up tiny variations in pitch that carry through to your cortex (the part of your brain responsible for getting information from) and create an awareness or experience of what’s going on around you.	electroencephalogram	Explain electroencephalogram using an analogy involving listening to a game.
A photocopier machine prints a copy of what it is printing, without the actual text. This analogy can be used to Describe how DNA replication works: A photocopy machine takes a single page from a book and creates an exact duplicate of that page, without the illustrations or other content.	dna replication	Explain dna replication using an analogy involving photocopier machine.
A photocopier machine reproduces a copy of something that has been photo-copied. The photocopier fires the laser beam at one end of the image forming cassette, and then records the color prints on the other side.	dna replication	Explain dna replication using an analogy involving photocopier machine.
A photocopier machine duplicates items by taking a page out of a book and putting it back together again. This is done by turning the pages until you get to what you want. The same thing happens with genes when they are replicated—they are turned into proteins, which are put back together (polished) as if there were never any initial Errors. Dna replication uses similar principles but instead of pages from books, we use pieces of DNA that have been chopped up into smaller pieces and then rejoined using enzymes.	dna replication	Explain dna replication using an analogy involving photocopier machine.
A photocopier machine copies large chunks of text or image data by taking the output of one part and making a copy that is about the same size but with different colors. This process is called "reproducing." The result of this copying is then mailed to another person, who can look at it without having to cut and paste it together.	dna replication	Explain dna replication using an analogy involving photocopier machine.
Dna replication is analogous to photocopying. When you photocopy something, the paper does not have to be perfectly level - there are valleys and hills where the copying will not go quite as smoothly because of variation in humidity or light levels. The same is true with dna replication; errors will occur even if all the pieces of DNA are uniform. That's why it's important that each person taking part in a dna project be familiar with some basic principles of genetics so they can make sure their copy of the genetic sequence is correct.	dna replication	Explain dna replication using an analogy involving photocopier machine.
Book printing is a process of manufacturing sheets of paper out of large sheets of different colors. The sheet backing is then cut to size and the colorful pages are put together, one on top of the other. Then, sheaths (or wrapping) are added around the pages to keep them in place as they're printed.	dna replication	Explain dna replication using an analogy involving book printing.
Book printing is a process of making copies of books by pressing them through a pressurizedoksiferous fluid. The titles and other text pages are printed on large sheets of paper that are then cut into smaller pieces and sewn together to create the finished book. Bookbinding also uses presses, but it involves stitching the pages together rather than pressing them perforated with dies.	dna replication	Explain dna replication using an analogy involving book printing.
Dna replication is like printing book pages. A printer prints one page at a time, then takes the next page and starts to print it again. The same thing happens with our brains - we think one thought at a time and that's how our memories are stores. When we remember something, it's written down as a text file called "memory" in our brain (am I explaining this correctly?). Then, when we want to remember that memory again, all we have to do is open up the text file and read from its beginning!	dna replication	Explain dna replication using an analogy involving book printing.
Book printing involves taking a sheet of paper and making small copies using a press. This process is repeated hundreds of times, copying the same information many times over. The sheets are then bound together and sent off to be printed one after the other.	dna replication	Explain dna replication using an analogy involving book printing.
Book printing is the process of duplicating a copy of a book. The first copies are made onto paper, and then these papers are cut into small pieces that can be inserted into an envelope and sent to the publisher. The publisher will then hand-patch each piece together, ensuring that all pages are facing in the same direction and that there is nogyroscope distortion.	dna replication	Explain dna replication using an analogy involving book printing.
One analogy to explain rna transcription is that of language translation. In a similar way, RNA transcripts are translated into proteins in the body. A particular gene can be expressed in one person and not another due to differences in genetic makeup; similarly, some RNAs may only be transcribed once per cell and not all of them will ever translate into protein. However, because DNA copies itself constantly, it's possible for every enzyme to act on every mRNA by creating a brand-new transcript (and sometimes miscegenating different transcripts). This process leads to the creation of what we call "diseases" such as Huntington's disease or Parkinson's disease.	rna transcription	Explain rna transcription using an analogy involving language translation.
RNA transcription is the process of translating mRNA into a recognizable genetic sequence.	rna transcription	Explain rna transcription using an analogy involving language translation.
There are a few ways to think of text transcription. One way is to think of it as taking the meaning out of a sentence and putting it into another language. For example, you might translate "I love you" into Spanish as "Te quiero." The translation will be different each time, but the idea is that the translator takes what was said in one language and turns it into something else that someone else can understand.The other way to think about transcription is as translating between two languages. Your brain doesn't actually understand English so your mind tries to put emotions and words together like we do with translations - except instead of trying to make sense out of individual letters, your brain maps them onto sounds or phonemes which then happen to be stored in your memory (or at least I'm assuming this happens). This also makes transcripts much more vulnerable because remember that just because we can read and write doesn't mean scripts or grammar get translated into our own languages automatically - anything could still go wrong!	rna transcription	Explain rna transcription using an analogy involving language translation.
When you translate a sentence from one language to another, what you are doing is essentially translating the words into photons. Just as with any other form of communication, when youtranslate a sentence, you are exchanging information between two people or things. The process begins with creating an abstract version of the original text, or model, and then applying some basic principles of physics to it. Next, you use your own unique set of skills in order to combine these different ideas and create something that can be understood by either person or thing. This is where translation comes in - once again we are using our own natural abilities to help us understand someone else's message while also preserving the essential grammar and syntaxof the original Spanish text.	rna transcription	Explain rna transcription using an analogy involving language translation.
When you speak a language, the words that are spoken come in groups of pieces called sentences. The sounds that people make and the pronouns they use are all made up of these individual sentence fragments. Then, when someone wants to write or type those same fragments out into a text, they need to separate them into lines by adding commas and making other decisions about how much space each fragment should have.	rna transcription	Explain rna transcription using an analogy involving language translation.
When a scientist learns one language, they may be able to learn another. This is the same type of process that happens when you learn a new trade or hobby. You must practice and learn how to do it in order to be successful at it. Once you’ve learned some basics, then you can start translating what people say into other languages. The same thing happens with protein translation: We have to know how to translate something from one form (such as mRNA) into another form (such as amino acids).	protein translation	Explain protein translation using an analogy involving language translation.
In language translation, the translator is responsible for converting one set of words into another. For example, when I say "I am," you could say "You are" or even just "you." In protein translation, though, the translator is not limited to converting single words into another form; they can also convert entire sequences of amino acids into a new form. Translation involves breaking down large stretches of text and translating them into smaller small pieces that the brain can understand.	protein translation	Explain protein translation using an analogy involving language translation.
A protein is translated from one language into another using a set of normal proteins that carry out the process. The translator then uses special machinery to interpret the original text and produce a product that can be consumed by the recipient.	protein translation	Explain protein translation using an analogy involving language translation.
A protein is translated into a long string of readable code that can be stored in the brain. The translate machine takes all of the information in the mRNA and translates it into a different form that can be used by your muscles.	protein translation	Explain protein translation using an analogy involving language translation.
 Translation is the process of converting one language into another. When you speak a word in your head, your brain understands it as a sequence of sound waves that are translated into text or other form. The same thing happens when you write something down – your mind converts the words into an image or set of data that can be understood by someone else.	protein translation	Explain protein translation using an analogy involving language translation.
The city is a complex ecosystem, made up of individual humans and their animals, plants, soil and air. The environment around the city is also important – it contains all the resources that make up the city's economy (water, energy, asphalt), as well as all the pollution that comes from living in a big place.	ecosystem	Explain ecosystem using an analogy involving cities.
An ecosystem is a network of living things, each with its own benefits and challenges. In the context of cities, an ecosystem includes both the physical environment within which people live and work as well as all other city-related institutions and components.	ecosystem	Explain ecosystem using an analogy involving cities.
An ecosystem is a web of life that includes everything from microbes to trees. In the city, each individual building and object can stand in its own ecosystem, interacting with other buildings and objects around it. The environment in which a person lives and works is also an important part of the city's ecology.	ecosystem	Explain ecosystem using an analogy involving cities.
An ecosystem is a community of plants and animals that interact with one another. In the simplest terms, an ecosystem consists of all of the objects and organisms that are found within it: water droplets, soil particles, bugs, spiders, etc. The environment in which these objects and organisms live helps to support them and creates a webbing effect between different parts of the organism.	ecosystem	Explain ecosystem using an analogy involving cities.
A city is like an ecosystem. The environment in a city is constantly changing due to the people and products that live, work, and play there.	ecosystem	Explain ecosystem using an analogy involving cities.
A neuron can propagate an action potential down its dendrite by following the released neurotransmitters and ions. These actions potentials will eventually travel back up the dendrite, arriving at another neuron before it has time to firmer. This analogy is useful because neurons are individual cells and not entire networks like a computer system.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron using an analogy involving falling dominoes.
A neuron fires an action potential when it takes in a new electrical stimulation and sends out a neurotransmitter to the next neuron. The propagation of an action potential down a neuron is like the dominoes that fall, one after the other, until they reach their destination. Once there, the neurotransmitters activate those cells that were stimulated before and help them function as intended.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron using an analogy involving falling dominoes.
A neuron can propagate an action potential down its axon like a dominoes. The first domino to fall is the presynaptic cell, which sends a spike of electricity coursing through the nervous system. Next, the next neuron in line sends a sparks of electricity back up their own axon, and so on until all of these neurons have sent spikes back down their respective lines. This process continues until all cells in your neuronal network have sent trip currents flashing across their cytoplasmic membranes.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron using an analogy involving falling dominoes.
A neuron fires when it receives a message from one of its cells. The first domino in the chain is the cell that sends a chemical messenger called an action potential down the neuron. This signal tells the cell to start firing again, and so on down the line.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron using an analogy involving falling dominoes.
If you look at a dominoes game and see that one piece goes down, then the next piece will go down too. The same is true with an action potential: one unit of electricity goes up (and it's called a 'volt') and then comes back DOWN (or propagates through the neuron). This process happens over and over again as different cells in your brain fire off action potentials!	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron using an analogy involving falling dominoes.
When you blow into a balloon, the air pressure inside the balloon decreases. This decrease in pressure causes the Balloon to inflate more quickly than if it hadn't been blown up at all. The same is true when you breathe: when we exhale, the atmospheric pressure outside of our lungs decreases. This decreased pressure causes our breathing muscles to contract and pushqe air out of our mouths ( ventilation).	breathing mechanism of frogs	Explain breathing mechanism of frogs using an analogy involving blowing of the balloon.
When you blow the balloon, you are using your mouth to suck in air. The same is done with frogs when they breathe. When they inhale, their next step is to hold their breath and then exhale through their nose.	breathing mechanism of frogs	Explain breathing mechanism of frogs using an analogy involving blowing of the balloon.
Breathing in and out is done with the mouth open, just like when you blow into a balloon. The air pressure inside the balloon caused the gas to rise up and escape from the top of the balloon. This same process happens when you breathe, with your lungs taking in air and pushing it back out through your nose and mouth.	breathing mechanism of frogs	Explain breathing mechanism of frogs using an analogy involving blowing of the balloon.
When a person blows into a balloon, they create air pressure inside the balloon. The same principle applies to frogs when they breathe: They create air pressure within their lungs by breathing in and exhaling. When an frog inhales, they buy enough altitude (space) in their lungs for their eardrums to expand, which then forces the front of the mouth open wide and allows them to take in oxygenated blood from the atmosphere. To let go of air later on, frogs suck in more atmospheric gas than they need and this extra breath is released as waste products such as carbon dioxide or water vaporExplode through a small opening at one end called an "alveolus," these gas pockets contract again during respiration causing fresh oxygenated blood to enter Aquaculture Science 293-2004	breathing mechanism of frogs	Explain breathing mechanism of frogs using an analogy involving blowing of the balloon.
When you blow into a balloon, the air pressure inside the balloon increases. This increased pressure causes gas to escape from the tire and space between the inner layer of your mouth and tongue (the alveoli), which forms an opening called a “breathing hole”. The greater amount of gas available in the balloons causes them to burst sooner than when there is less atmospheric pressure. When you exhale, your breath pops all these bubbles out of your lungs, causing us to feel as though we have taken more oxygen than we actually did.	breathing mechanism of frogs	Explain breathing mechanism of frogs using an analogy involving blowing of the balloon.
A communication system has three layers: the physical layer, the transmission layer, and the receiving layer. The physical layer is used to convey information from one object to another. The transmissionLayer uses coaxial cables, microwave ovens, or other similar means to send data packets over a distance. The receiving Layer listens for transmissions and extracts the data desired by translating it into an appropriate format for its destination. This process can be done manually or automatically through software applications like Microsoft Word or Google Earth.	layered architecture	Explain layered architecture using an analogy involving communication with translators.
A translator is like a phone switch that can be turned on or off. When you talk to someone in a language they don't understand, the translator is able to help hear what you're saying and put it into English. The translation process involves translating from one language to another, but it's also possible for the translator to copy and paste words exactlyAGood way so that both parties are getting the same message.	layered architecture	Explain layered architecture using an analogy involving communication with translators.
A communication network Topology is like a series of trenches in an Allied front pushing forward to support the attack against German positions. The different levels of the Network are like the different translations or paraphrases of one language into another, translating reliable messages from higher up to lower down on the chain where they can be received and processed by those at their knees. Some translation may take place simultaneously other translation might happen serially depending on how much information is being transmitted at any given time	layered architecture	Explain layered architecture using an analogy involving communication with translators.
A layer in a communication process is like an interpreter. Every time one speaks, the speaker sends commands to the interpreter which are then interpreted and yielding results back to the sender. In such a process, layers can be designed according to the needs of specific recipients or parties involved in the communication.	layered architecture	Explain layered architecture using an analogy involving communication with translators.
Translators are like our eardrums. They help us hear the conversation in other languages, but also allow us to understand what is being said without having to listen carefully. The same principle applies to software layers: each layer helps make a message more accessible and manageable, while still allowing for privacy and security. In this analogy, the translator is akin to the microphone in an audio player; it allows you to pick up the conversation between two people, but also protects you from eavesdroppers (figure 1).	layered architecture	Explain layered architecture using an analogy involving communication with translators.
Chocolate is a store-bought product with a distribution of 0.5% to 1%. The most important reactant in chocolate is cocoa butter, which makes up 60% of the mixture.  Excess reactants are caused by either overapplication or not applying enough heat when making chocolate. Overproduction can cause Pistachio bars to be too sweet and Boursin cheese to have an off flavor.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain limiting reactant and excess reactant using an analogy involving chocolate distribution.
An example of a limiting reactant is potassium carbonate. When there are too many potassium carbonate molecules in solution, it will form a Solid K4 (or black) precipitate. The excess potassium carbonate molecule will cause the chocolate torothalles to form and produce an unpleasant odor.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain limiting reactant and excess reactant using an analogy involving chocolate distribution.
ALimit Reactant: This is the amount of reactant present in a solution. In chocolate, there are two types of reactants- sweet and bitter. The more acidic reactions occur at the lower levels while the higher level reactions produce a sweeter product. For example, when you add 1/2 cup of baking soda to 6 cups of water it creates two Limit Reactants- baking soda and water. When adding milk to this mixture it results in four limit reactants- cow's milk, butter, cream cheese, and milk powder.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain limiting reactant and excess reactant using an analogy involving chocolate distribution.
Chocolate is a hard and intense sweetener used in baking, pastrycing, sauce making and other food processes. In these activities it takes the place of sugar which can create undesirable flavors or dough tasters may not like because they perceive chocolate as being too sweet. The same analogy could be made for reactants involved in combustion: air and water are both important reactants in combustion but there are limits to what each one can do. Air can turn into CO2 (a greenhouse gas) while water vapor (H2O) cannot. These two gases balance each other out so that the resulting mixture has a desired properties such as heat rejection,fuel economy,and explosiveness	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain limiting reactant and excess reactant using an analogy involving chocolate distribution.
The analogy is that when you make chocolate, the ingredients are melted and then boiled until it forms a smooth paste. In business, limiting reactants means that each person has a small amount of something that does the work of making many things happen simultaneously. excess reactants means there is too much of something and it causes an uncontrolled reaction. When two people have too much chocolate in their hands, they can end up with peppermint extract on their clothes ornaments because the extraction process caused more than what was needed to make candy from the Chocolate set-up.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain limiting reactant and excess reactant using an analogy involving chocolate distribution.

A working office is like a department in an organization. There are many different responsibilities for each person within the department, and everyone knows their job and what to do when they hear something that needs to be done.

A prokaryotic cell is like a self-started business. It starts by creating some DNA, and then manufacturing proteins that help it survive and grow.	prokaryotic cell	Explain prokaryotic cell using an analogy involving self started business.
A prokaryotic cell is like a business that starts with the idea of creating something new. The prokaryotic cell creates proteins and DNA by using replication errors to create genetic material. Once these materials are created, the prokaryotic cell can start creating more cells by replicating itself until it has enough cells to create a response or product.	prokaryotic cell	Explain prokaryotic cell using an analogy involving self started business.
A prokaryotic cell is like a business that starts with the idea of making some coffee. The cells in your body are similar to the coffee beans, and they offer their services in order to create new products or molecules. In the same way, prokaryotes start by creating DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and proteins in their cells, which give those cells the ability to make more copies of themselves. To continue producing new substances, prokaryotic cells must use energy from breaking down food into tiny pieces that can be used for growth or energy creation.	prokaryotic cell	Explain prokaryotic cell using an analogy involving self started business.
In prokaryotic cells, the self-replicating process is responsible for creating new cells. In prokaryotic cells, DNA replication Cascade can be described as a sequence of automated events that result in the creation of one daughter cell from two parental donor cells.	prokaryotic cell	Explain prokaryotic cell using an analogy involving self started business.

The linux kernel was released in 1994 by Linus Torvalds	operating systems kernel	Explain operating systems kernel using an analogy involving college library.
The operating system kernel is like the library of a college. It stores the function and data for programs that run on your computer, and provides an interface between these programs and the rest of your computer.	operating systems kernel	Explain operating systems kernel using an analogy involving college library.
A limited reactant is one that can only interact with a specific number of other substances. For example, if you add 10 cups of coffee granules to a pot of water, the Reaction Potential (RP) for those particles will be very high and it will create a significant chemical reaction. However, if you added 1000 cups of coffee granules to the same pot of water, the RP would be much lower and there would be much less chance for any reactions occurring.	limiting reactant	Explain limiting reactant using an analogy involving a cup of coffee granules.
A cup of coffee granules contain a limited amount of caffeine. When you take a sip of coffee, the first thing that comes into your mouth is the water content (of course without any beans). Then there are the grounds which are used to make roasts and also have other flavors (almonds, chocolate etc). Finally, some oils or fats have been added to create a smooth texture.	limiting reactant	Explain limiting reactant using an analogy involving a cup of coffee granules.
If you add water to a cup of coffee granules, it will turn into a pot of coffee. The same is true with reactants- when they are added to other substances, like oxygen and nitrogen in air, they will combine and create an output1989 gas.	limiting reactant	Explain limiting reactant using an analogy involving a cup of coffee granules.
One cup of coffee granules contains about 8,000 degrees Fahrenheit. If you put a teaspoonful of thesegranules in your mouth, it would take many minutes for them to heat up from the cold ground state. The same is true with reactants- if we put a lot of reactants into an equation, it will slowly and surely pull other reactants and atoms together until there's nothing left to make more radicals or molecules. This analogy couldn't be further from the truth! Reactants are like coffee granules- they can only go so far before they freeze solid.	limiting reactant	Explain limiting reactant using an analogy involving a cup of coffee granules.
Water is a reactant in the brewing of coffee. The cup of water granules has about three times as much water as the beans, so it takes up almost all of the space in the mug.	limiting reactant	Explain limiting reactant using an analogy involving a cup of coffee granules.
An engine is a type of machine that can turn products into motion. A limited reactant could be someone who does the same thing as the engine, but with less power or speed. For example, you might compare an engine to a producevessel. The producevesell carries objects up water where they will be turned into money or other products.	limiting reactant	Explain limiting reactant using an analogy involving engine.
A fuel-injected engine gasoline mixture contains a limited number of reactants. The most common are air and oil, but there is also something called "fuel taxes" that gets added to the mix for each vehicle. These Taxes help fund government operations.	limiting reactant	Explain limiting reactant using an analogy involving engine.
An analogy for limitingreactant is an engine. In a gasoline engine, the reactants are air and oil. The Engine produces power when it crushes fuel and air together to create hot gas.

A zipper is made up of many loops that connect one another. This analogy can be used to describe how helicases are made up of loops that connect and join other loops.	helicase	Explain helicase using an analogy involving zipper zip.
Zipperzip is the name for a type of metal zipper that uses an sigma wave coil to create pullcords. When you put something inside the zip (in this analogy, it's a virus), the piezoelectricity of the metal causes current to flow through it in both directions, creating a “snap” sound when you pull on the cord.	helicase	Explain helicase using an analogy involving zipper zip.
A helicase is like a zipper. Itzips along the DNA molecule, splitting it into pieces that can be used by another process. The helicase also helps to hold together the ends of the strands so they stay joined.	helicase	Explain helicase using an analogy involving zipper zip.
A zipper is an example of a helicase. When two pieces of material are close to each other, the helicase N-src helps to ensure that these pieces remain together by tearing them apart along the zips. This happens because helices are overlapping strands of DNA and can’t help themselves from pulling apart when they need to fix something specifically in relationship to one another.	helicase	Explain helicase using an analogy involving zipper zip.
A helicase is a protein that helps attach two pieces of DNA together. Shepherding the strands through the growing enzyme-catalyzed dance, helicases help keep the chromosome stable by cutting and rejoining segments as needed.	helicase	Explain helicase using an analogy involving zipper zip.

The two strips of magnet are thought to represent the replication fork in DNA. The binding proteins on either side of the fork adsorb to one another and stabilize it, making it easier for thedivision of genetic material between strands to happen.	dna replication binding proteins	Explain dna replication binding proteins using an analogy involving hands holding open two strips of magnet.
The hand holding the strip of magnet wants to keep it close to thestrip while allowing the other person to pick up the strip and place it in their pocket. The same is happening with dna replication proteins. They want to stick close enough to the replicating DNA but not so tight that they stop its ability to replicated.	dna replication binding proteins	Explain dna replication binding proteins using an analogy involving hands holding open two strips of magnet.
Dna replication binding proteins are analogous to hands that hold open two strips of magnet. They help to hold the DNA molecules in place so that they can be replicated correctly.	dna replication binding proteins	Explain dna replication binding proteins using an analogy involving hands holding open two strips of magnet.

Encoding is like speaking. You encode a message by putting it into different forms so that other people can understand it. For example, you might encoding the text of a letter with symbols to make it easier for someone to read.	message encoding	Explain message encoding using an analogy involving speaking.
 encoders are like speakers, they encode information by making it into audible sound. One example is the English vernacular that we use to communicate. When an Encoder encoding a message decides on a particular style or language for transmission, they will create an algorithm that scrambles the data so that only selected words and phrases are transmitted.	message encoding	Explain message encoding using an analogy involving speaking.
When you speak, your voice is like a microphone. The air pressure inside the microphone is greater than outside air and this difference creates sound. In the same way, when we encode text using ASCII code, our ears hear each letter as one block of data. So, for example, "abc" would be encoded as "ABABC", while "defg" would be encoding as "DAAA".	message encoding	Explain message encoding using an analogy involving speaking.
A message can be encoded as a set of sounds that are heard when spoken aloud. Each sound is said to have its own memory, and the encoding algorithm tries to groups these sounds together so that they make sense together.	message encoding	Explain message encoding using an analogy involving speaking.
When you speak, your mouth opens and the words come out. The same thing happens when you encode a message. Your mind digests what you hear and creates symbols to represent it.	message encoding	Explain message encoding using an analogy involving speaking.
Drugs and receptors interact in a process called agonism. This means that when the drug binds to the receptor, it can cause an increase in activity (a response) within the receptor. An antagonist action would decrease (be anti-inhibited or less effective) this effect of the drug on the receptor.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain interaction between drugs and receptor sites using an analogy involving lock and key.
A lock is a physical object that helps secure an item in a room. The key, on the other hand, is the tool used to open the lock. Drug interaction might involve locking and unlocking receptor sites as well as administering or receiving drug doses through those sites.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain interaction between drugs and receptor sites using an analogy involving lock and key.
Two people may be playing together with a key in their hand. If one person tries to open the door, they can only try to turn it by hitting the key while the other person is holding onto it and preventing them from turning it. The same is true for drug interactions: if one person takes a Drug A and then takes Drug B, there will likely be an interaction between those two drugs that cannot be easily predicted or undone.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain interaction between drugs and receptor sites using an analogy involving lock and key.
Drugs can interact with receptor sites in a number of ways, depending on the nature of the drug and its interaction with other ligands. A lock analogy would be that drugs can bind to receptors in different ways to affect how they function. Keys could be analogyically placed at specific points on the Lock icon to illustrate this point. For example, if you wanted to open a door using just one key, you would use that key to unlock the entire door while still holding onto the others keys (or vice versa).	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain interaction between drugs and receptor sites using an analogy involving lock and key.
When you put a key in the lock of your door, the keypress creates a series of vibrations that generate an electric current. The same process happens when drugs are taken into the body – these vibrations create gates and locks on drug-receptor areas, which can be opened with a suitable ligand or agent.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain interaction between drugs and receptor sites using an analogy involving lock and key.
When it comes to drug interactions, foot fitting is a good analogy to think about. When you put your foot in the print of the shoe, that means your ankle and foot are interacting with each other. This happens when you take a medication and it makes its way into your blood stream through these specific sites on the inside of your ankle and then into your bloodstream. The same thing happens when two people have sex; their body will create an interaction between them by creating pressure on different areas of the skin.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain interaction between drugs and receptor sites using an analogy involving foot fitting in footprint.
One way to think of drug interaction is that drugs act on receptor sites in ways that create a footprint (space within which an action can take place). This space depends on the drug and the receptor site. The footprint size is determined by how well the drug fits into the receptors' space, as well as by how closely it matches the shape and size of those receptors.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain interaction between drugs and receptor sites using an analogy involving foot fitting in footprint.
There are many drugs that can be used to treat diseases and conditions. One common drug is afoot, which is a type of FitBit device that helps track steps taken and energy expended. The foot fit into the footprint of the drug, so like any other physical activity, it needs to be monitored carefully in order to determine if it's cutting off access to important receptor sites.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain interaction between drugs and receptor sites using an analogy involving foot fitting in footprint.
When you put your foot in the footprint of a shoe, it helps to find its fit. The same is true for drug interactions; by understanding how drugs interact with receptors, we can better plan and prepare us for possible interactions.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain interaction between drugs and receptor sites using an analogy involving foot fitting in footprint.
If you are trying to fit a foot in the footprint of another person, you need to first find their shoe size and then find the corresponding hole on their foot. Once you have that information, you can begin fitting your own foot into the shoes.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain interaction between drugs and receptor sites using an analogy involving foot fitting in footprint.

A motherboard is a piece of hardware that includes the circuits needed to manage and control your computer's electrical signals. The boards on most computers are made from metal and plastic, but itanium processors like Intel Sandy Bridge use more energy-efficient materials such as aluminum and magnesium to create thesecircuits.	motherboard	Explain motherboard using an analogy involving skeleton.
A noun is like a muscle, and you can use analogy to describe how it works. For example, when I say that my neurons are working together as one unit (a metaphor), what I'm saying is that these cells are synchronized in their movements. This coordinated motion eventually produces an output or response from the neuron(s). The same thing goes forram! When we talk about a pre-frontal lobe criminal brain function, we're talking about its functioning as a single point of control. That's why RAMBLING WITH RAGRAMS feels so familiar - our brains have been doing this type of thinking since before civilization even formed!	ram	Explain ram using an analogy involving pre-frontal lobe.
There are a few things you need to understand when trying to think about what ram is. First, anything that has mass is likelyWikipedia:to have some form of force associated with it. This might be physical or emotional, depending on how much the object weighs. Second, something typically behaves in one way because of its mass and size compared to other objects nearby.

Coral's age calculation is similar to that of a tree. The coral grows in the ocean and becomes older as it reproduces. When its coral colony dies, the skeletons are recycled into new corals which will become older still.	tree's age calculation	Explain tree's age calculation using an analogy involving coral's age calculation.
Coral's age is calculation involves the number of years it has lived. Coral lives for acertain amount of time and then dies. The older coral pieces are collected and analyzed to figure out how long they have been alive, and this information is used in their age calculation.	tree's age calculation	Explain tree's age calculation using an analogy involving coral's age calculation.
One way to explain the tree's age calculation would be to analogy it to coral. Coral growth is regulated by a set of guidelines, and as the plant grows older its guidelines change. In the same way, trees grow older according to a set of rules that are changing with time.	tree's age calculation	Explain tree's age calculation using an analogy involving coral's age calculation.
An analogy to explain tree's age calculation would be like Rocky Mountains being compared to coral. Coral grows very slowly, taking many years for a full recruiting of new corals.

If you threw a ball at your plate and hit it with all your strength, the ball would most likely bounce off the table. Similarly, if you were to stoke up the air pressure in your room and place a hand over my mouth, I could barely hold my breath because I'm effectively closing off my nose. When we make contact with something - be it our noses or hands - we create an "anti-stokes scattering" effect. This is due to how materials scatter little particles of energy in every direction (known as Rayleigh scattering). The more scattered tiny pieces are, the less powerful our attack will be.	anti-stokes scattering	Explain anti-stokes scattering using an analogy involving ball striking a plate.
When you hit a ball with your hand, the force of the ball hitting the plate is greater than the pull of gravity. This is because as soon as you contact the surface of a metal object there's an instant electric and magnetic field generated by atoms in that metal. The amount of force created by this electric andmagnetic fields depends on how much kinetic energy (energy stored in molecules) exists within that area when the object makes contact. The more kinetic energy there is, or "the more power" it has, the more powerful these fields will be. So if you smash a ping-pong ball hard against a metal desk, you'll create a really strong Magnetic Field which will scatter photons around very quickly - faster than anything else can!	anti-stokes scattering	Explain anti-stokes scattering using an analogy involving ball striking a plate.
When a ball hits a plate, the impact causes small pieces of metal to scatter in all directions. The same is true with anti-stokes scattering: when a photon slips through an anti-Stokes layer, it can cause some photons to scatter into different directions.	anti-stokes scattering	Explain anti-stokes scattering using an analogy involving ball striking a plate.
When a ball is struck by something else, such as a doorKnocker, the sound of the hitting object and the air pressure inside the container are cancel each other out. This happens because light waves passing through an obstruction (like a door Knocker) cannot travel in two directions at once but must pass through both obstacles before reaching their destination.	anti-stokes scattering	Explain anti-stokes scattering using an analogy involving ball striking a plate.
When you hit a ball with your hand, the force of the collision is greater than the pull of gravity. The same thing is true when you scatter a piece of paper with your fingers; the air pressure outside will try to push the paper out from under your fingers, whereas gravity pulls it in.	anti-stokes scattering	Explain anti-stokes scattering using an analogy involving ball striking a plate.
When two pieces of metal are attracted to each other by a force, the ends of the metals will "stoke" as they approach each other. This means that more and more area on either side of the metal is filled with energy, until eventually there's an explosive Barnett sound when the metals collide.	stokes scattering	Explain stokes scattering using an analogy involving ball striking a plate.
Stokes scattering is the process by which small particles (like electrons) scatter in all directions when they are tossed around by a Collider. When an electron scatters across a large surface it creates a big clump of tiny pieces called stokes pockets.	stokes scattering	Explain stokes scattering using an analogy involving ball striking a plate.
Stokes scattering is the type of scattering that takes place when two materials come into contact with each other. The two materials will scatter particles in all directions, but some will hit the outside surface of the first material and fall to the ground. This leaves aiwthThe secondmaterial which has not been disturbed bythe original impact and will bounce off nearby surfaces without hitting anything.	stokes scattering	Explain stokes scattering using an analogy involving ball striking a plate.
If you hit a ball with your hand, there is an "action" or "impact" of the ball with your hand. The same is true when you scatter a pebble off of a surface- like a table. There is an "action" or "impact" of the pebble with your hand and arm as it is scattered across the surface.	stokes scattering	Explain stokes scattering using an analogy involving ball striking a plate.
If you light a ball of gas with a spark, it will scatter in all directions. This is why you can't just hit the ball with your hand - if you do, there'll be many pieces of gas scattered around. Likewise, when you push or touch something hard with your hands and feet, they also cause small particles to scatter in all directions.	stokes scattering	Explain stokes scattering using an analogy involving ball striking a plate.
The median lethal dose is the amount of toxin that will kill 50% of wild animals, as opposed to a human. For example, if you had a container of rattlesnakes in your house and offered them 100 pieces of salt every day for 10 days, then over time the rat population would decrease by 50%. However, if you offered 100 pieces of rattlesnakes each time there was an earthquake then one could hypothetically survive because their venom would only kill 15-20% of creatures.	median lethal dose	Explain median lethal dose using an analogy involving balls and target.
A median lethal dose is the quantity of a poison that causes death in 50% or more of its victims. The Targetin project was designed to lower the mortality rate for children by 50%. In order to achieve this, an antidote had to be developed that would kill 99.9% of test subjects within minutes after their exposure.	median lethal dose	Explain median lethal dose using an analogy involving balls and target.
The median lethal dose for a ball is about 8.4 grams. For a target, the median lethal dose is 1 millionth of a gram.	median lethal dose	Explain median lethal dose using an analogy involving balls and target.
A median lethal dose is the amount of a poison that will kill 50% of its users, or the average amount which causes death in a particular population. The figure might also be used to describe how dangerous something is before it kills you.	median lethal dose	Explain median lethal dose using an analogy involving balls and target.
A median lethal dose (MLD) is the expected lethal dose of a poison according to its ability to kill 50% of test subjects at various doses. A ball produces an LD 50 of 100 milligrams, so a person exposed to one would die within hours if only contact was made with the ball. If someone were alsoto swallow theball, their death would likely come several days later. The same goes for anything else that might be ingested by someone ingestioning the Poison Mixture Deficiency Syndrome (PMSD) antidote--50 milligrams provides almostkillinaldoses when taken orally.	median lethal dose	Explain median lethal dose using an analogy involving balls and target.
The surface of a balloon is like the universe. It's constantly expanding and contracting, and it doesn't have a natural stop.	universe	Explain universe using an analogy involving surface of a balloon.
A balloon is like a room in which you can see everything happening. The surface of the balloon is very large, so you can see all the objects inside it and all the surrounding surfaces.	universe	Explain universe using an analogy involving surface of a balloon.
A balloon has a surface that appears to be flat. However, when you look closely, you see that there is something strange and shiny on the inside of the balloon - it's made up of particles! The same thing happens with the universe - everything in it seems like an acceptable surface until you get closer and start looking more carefully. When you do this, you notice that there are huge amounts of energy fields all around us - they're just like those particle-like objects on the inside of balloons.	universe	Explain universe using an analogy involving surface of a balloon.
A balloon has a surface that is always the same, no matter where you point it. The universe is like this too- there is an unchanging surface on which everything happens. Everything in the universe exists and interacts with each other at all times, even in tiny ways.	universe	Explain universe using an analogy involving surface of a balloon.
A balloon has a surface that is made up of gas. The gas is surrounded by a larger pressure. This greater pressure makes the gas more dense than air and will cause it to rise up in the balloon. If you put your hand inside the balloon, you can feel how high it’s going to go because the pressure outside is greater than what's inside.	universe	Explain universe using an analogy involving surface of a balloon.
Enzyme mechanism is like a lock and key. Enzymes are proteins that catalyze chemical reactions in the body. When you give somebody a key to your house, they can opened all of the locks but one (the door handle). But if you leave the key out of the equation, eventually someone will try to open the door without getting it (by sneaking around) and probably won't get very far because there isn't anything on or inside the Keyhole to grab onto!	enzyme mechanism	Explain enzyme mechanism using an analogy involving lock and key.
A lock is a type of device used to secure objects within a certain space. A key is a tool that opens the lock. Enzymes are also devices used to secure items within a certain space and they work in much the same way as keys. The difference between enzymes and locks, though, is that enzymes can transformsmall molecules into larger molecules whilelocks require an object (the key) to be inserted into the lock and turned.	enzyme mechanism	Explain enzyme mechanism using an analogy involving lock and key.
 Enzyme is like a lock and key, which are used to open door. The enzyme works by eating the carbon dioxide from the air, turning it into hydrogen gas and then releasing the oxygen. This process happens constantly in your body, opening and closing doors all day long!	enzyme mechanism	Explain enzyme mechanism using an analogy involving lock and key.
Enzymes work by catalyzing reactions in the body. In lock and key, enzymes are like the keys that open the door of a laboratory. They help to perform specific tasks in the lab, such as turning starch into sugar or protein. Enzymes can also be used incorrectly (or fraudulently) to do dangerous or sensitive tasks in laboratories without knowing what they're doing!	enzyme mechanism	Explain enzyme mechanism using an analogy involving lock and key.
An enzyme mechanism is like a lock and key. The lock analogy would be used to explain how enzymes work. Enzymes are proteins that catalyze biochemical reactions in the body. They can also be considered as keys that open locks or doors. When you put a key into the lock, it turns the handle which unlocks the door from the inside. This same process happens with enzymes; they eat carbohydrates and amino acids, breaking them down into molecules that they can use for their chemical tasks in your body.	enzyme mechanism	Explain enzyme mechanism using an analogy involving lock and key.
Analogous to the signal in the noise, a coefficient is found in an ensuing analysis of variation data.	anova	Explain anova using an analogy involving finding signal in the noise.
One common analogy to explain anova is finding a signal in the noise. In this analogy, you are looking for patterns in the data that might indicate which factors (versus others) are responsible for different results.

Anova is a mathematical operation used to study the variation of individual values in data. It islike finding a signal in noise, by analyzing how it changes as you vary the conditions inside the experimental setup. InanOVA, you periodically change one or more of the experimental variables (e.g., variable A) while keeping all other variables constant (i.e., without controlling for them). Asa result, ananova compares how each variable affects the mean and standard deviation ofthe overall dataset when varied under these four different conditions permutationally.	anova	Explain anova using an analogy involving finding signal in the noise.

Heat is released when energy is stored in the form of bodyfat. The hypothalamus creates a feedback loop that stimulates temperature changes throughout the body when it senses an increase in energy stores, such as during exercise or growth. When temperatures rise too high, the hypothalamus sends signals to cool down our bodies and reduce activity.	thermostat	Explain thermostat using an analogy involving hypothalamus.

Chemical equilibrium is the state of a system in which all elements and compounds are in optimal proportions. Water level in dam will always be lower than the lake because water covers more surface area than soil. In the same way, when one combines different molecules into a whole they might move around like individuals at a party but eventually assemblage back to form the original molecule (or complex) The opposite happens with plants- their cells can grow taller if there's more water available but as soon as that water flow ceases or dwindles, so too does cell growth (because Calvin Coolidge said " rooting for reductionism - we shall use all means within our power to make it an effective tool").	chemical equilibrium	Explain chemical equilibrium using an analogy involving water level in dam and lake.
A water level in a dam is compared to the water level in a lake. A higher water level in the dam means that more water is stored and it can be released at will to create a flood. Conversely, a lower water level in the dam would indicate that less water is stored and it needs time for the natural forces such as wind and waves to	chemical equilibrium	Explain chemical equilibrium using an analogy involving water level in dam and lake.
When the water in a dam reaches its maximum level, it stops flowing. The same is true with lakes - when their water reach's an equilibrium point (usually near the bottom), they stop recirculating and start to fill up.	chemical equilibrium	Explain chemical equilibrium using an analogy involving water level in dam and lake.
When water level in a dam reaches its top, the water can no longer flow through the gates. This is because the pressure of the water has become too high. The gate is then opened and more water enters the dam from outside while less Water exits. Since this happens at different rates depending on how full adam is, chemical equilibrium eventually returns to normal when allexit valuables have beenGiven back into circulation	chemical equilibrium	Explain chemical equilibrium using an analogy involving water level in dam and lake.
When water levels in a dam or lake are high, the water is held back by land. When the level in the dam gets too low, it starts to spill out and weakens the dam. The same thing happens with petroleum: when production increases, oil spills into rivers and lakes as well.	chemical equilibrium	Explain chemical equilibrium using an analogy involving water level in dam and lake.

Just-in-time is a concept involving the time it takes for something to happen. For example, if you have an order of food that needs to be delivered on time, then you call the restaurant and ask them when they will have those specific items available. However, just as with water - there can be many factors involved in predicting how long things will take exactly, so same amounts of goods or services may not always arrive at the designated times. This is often referred to as "the art of prediction."	just-in-time	Explain just-in-time using an analogy involving water and rocks.

An electric circuit is like a tube of air that flows through it. When you plug something into an electrical outlet, the electricity in the outlet comes out and goes to wherever the thing you plugged it into was. The same thing happens with circuits: when you add things to them, like components or wires, the electricity runs along those lines and does work on things inside of circuits.	electric circuit	Explain electric circuit using an analogy involving air flowing through a tube.
An electric circuit is like a tube of air, which flows through it and creates an electrical current.	electric circuit	Explain electric circuit using an analogy involving air flowing through a tube.
Electric circuits are analogous to airflows through tubes. The electric current flows in one direction and the current around a circuit is used to generate new electricity.	electric circuit	Explain electric circuit using an analogy involving air flowing through a tube.
Electric circuits are like air flow through tubes. The difference is that electric current flows in one direction while air flow travels in the other. When you connect two different sources of electricity, it turns into a " Circuit." This analogy can help understand how electrical circuits work and what kind of things can be done with them.	electric circuit	Explain electric circuit using an analogy involving air flowing through a tube.
A electric circuit is like a network of metal rings. The Rings are connected in series, with the insidemost ring being responsible for supplying electricity to the next Ring in sequence, and so on. You can see this when you take out an old iPhone battery and test it by plugging it into your computer's charging cord and then back into your phone; the red wire from the battery goes through one ring (the actual charger), while yellow wire goes through another (the computer).	electric circuit	Explain electric circuit using an analogy involving rope through metal rings.
Electric circuits are like ropes through metal rings. The AC ( alternating current) electricity flows through the wire leading to the ring on the battery, and then goes back out the same way. This process is repeated over and over again as long as there's an electric load in between each loop of wire that gets Electricity from one side of the ring to another side	electric circuit	Explain electric circuit using an analogy involving rope through metal rings.
A simple electric circuit consisting of a metal ring and a wire is like a rope through two metal rings. The metal rings are positioned so that the charges on the wirebridge align with those on the Ring (or in this case, onion skin). When you connect one end of the wirebridge to another,Current flows from one side of the wirebridge to the other. This current is statical because it's returned by resistance in each Ring when you connect your ends - it doesn't flow out any further!	electric circuit	Explain electric circuit using an analogy involving rope through metal rings.
A electric circuit is like a rope through metal rings. When you plug one end of the rope into an electrical outlet and the other end into a wire, electricity flows from the outlet to the ring in between (the middle). This is how your home's power gets to your lights and appliances!	electric circuit	Explain electric circuit using an analogy involving rope through metal rings.
A electric circuit is like a steel chain running through metal rings. When you type in "electric circuits" on the internet, you're actually looking at copper wire going into and out of different metal ring structures. It's really easy to see how an electric current (or voltage) flows within these circles - by using an analogy that involves ropes!	electric circuit	Explain electric circuit using an analogy involving rope through metal rings.
If you put a water droplet on the side of your mouth, it will feel wet because the hydrophobic effect is effective in determining how liquid objects will interact with one another. The same is true for oils: they have anhydrous and lipophilic properties which are responsible for their ability to spread around when applied.	hydrophobic effect	Explain hydrophobic effect using an analogy involving teenagers at a party.
Some scientists say that the hydrophobic effect is like a teenager at a party. They are not allowed to have any drinks, so they must balance drinking enough water with being able to get around. Teenagers who can't drink often find themselves unable to move and become stranded. The same thing happens when people try to put things into their mouths that don't fit - they end up tongues-tied.	hydrophobic effect	Explain hydrophobic effect using an analogy involving teenagers at a party.
 Teens at a party might want to store spilled drinks away in an effort to prevent them from becoming mired in the drink. This would happen because hydrophobic substances (such as water) do not allow polarized forces, such as those created by metal tools and coins, to overcome their attraction to one another.	hydrophobic effect	Explain hydrophobic effect using an analogy involving teenagers at a party.
When you are at a party and there is nobody else to talk to, it's great! But if you want to get something done, the best way to do it is by forming small groups and talking to everyone in your group. This will help make sure that everyone has a chance to hear what you have to say and be able to contribute.	hydrophobic effect	Explain hydrophobic effect using an analogy involving teenagers at a party.
When a teenager is at a party, they are likely to be socializing and drinking alcohol. One of the ways that teenagers use their body chemistry to attract others is by hydrophobic effects - clinging to thingsrubbery or wet. This can happen when someone's skin feels slimy or icy after just being touching them.	hydrophobic effect	Explain hydrophobic effect using an analogy involving teenagers at a party.
It is easy to see how biological signals transduction works in animals. When an animal senses a threat, it sends out a warning signal. This signal includes information about the danger and the location of the threat. The message also includes factors like intensity, duration, and timing that help determine whether or not the animal should take action.	biological signal transduction	Explain biological signal transduction using an analogy involving threat communication in animals.
In animals, the body sends a warning signals to the brain when it senses an impending danger. For example, if you see a hawk hovering over your backyard, your heart might start pounding faster because you know that there is potential foragles to come down and steal your food. This type of communication is called "threat communication."	biological signal transduction	Explain biological signal transduction using an analogy involving threat communication in animals.
A biological signal transduction analogy would involve the process of sending a warning signal to an animal in order to warn it of a potential danger. When somethingNetwork Equipment has gone wrong, such as when one of its components fails, this can cause the animal to become alerted and therefore more likely to react in appropriate ways. The same principle could be applied to communication within societies: when Something Goes Wrong, society might send out a warning message in order to Inform others about what is happening.	biological signal transduction	Explain biological signal transduction using an analogy involving threat communication in animals.
A biological signal transduction analogy would involveOverview: Biological signals are transmitted through physical or chemical means to help animals communicate with each other. Signal transduction is the process by which a molecule in an animal's blood, nerve cells, or skin sends a message to the body's cells below about how well it is doing.	biological signal transduction	Explain biological signal transduction using an analogy involving threat communication in animals.
Animal threat communication includes the use of sound to indicate danger, body language to communicate dominance or submission, and scent to warn others. Each signal can be interpreted in different ways based on its context. For example, a loud noise might be used as an indication of danger to other animals, while a low volume signal might be used as part of a warning strategy.	biological signal transduction	Explain biological signal transduction using an analogy involving threat communication in animals.
