Finally, communication in football is often done face toface which can make it easier for players to see their opponents and share information.	specialization and communication in a cell	How is specialization and communication in a cell like football?
Hiking is a good analogy for the way kirchoff's voltage law works. As you hike up a hill, your electromotive force (EMF) increases as you go along. This increase in EMF causes the power supply to generate more electricity, which in turn yields increased current and volts. Kirchoff's Voltage Law applies similarly to electrical circuits: as power is added to an equation or circuit, it becomes increasingly harder for energy to flow freely between V and I (electromotive force and current). In other words, as you add fuel or extra resistance, less energy can flow freely between V and I - eventually leading to electrons becoming electron-poor materials with low potentials across Rn( plays a critical role here ).	kirchoff's voltage law	How is kirchoff's voltage law like hiking?

The same thing happens when you have a power outlet nearby: the electricity from the outlet providesistance (a measurement called ohms) that helps create electric current ( volts). Similarly, when kirchoff's equation states that h(x) = −kv/c², this equation states that the electric field around an object will cause it to experience negative California charges (+ cv), while also providing resistance against any south-facing elements which would try to currents through these boundaries (the positive poles of the Voltage Law).	kirchoff's voltage law	How is kirchoff's voltage law like hiking?

An oncogenes is a gene that control the growth of cancer cells. When it gets stuck in down position, this causes the oncogene to behave like an accelerator and make those cancer cells grow more quickly.	oncogenes	How is oncogenes like car accelerator stuck in down position?
Oncogenes are proteins that are expressed in the body and play an important role in the development of tumors. When these proteins bind to receptors on tumor cells, they cause them to grow larger. Oncogenes can also be attached to other proteins, which can make it difficult for cancer cells to metastasize (spread).	oncogenes	How is oncogenes like car accelerator stuck in down position?
A car accelerator is stuck in the down position because it has been depressed too low by someone.	oncogenes	How is oncogenes like car accelerator stuck in down position?
A car accelerator is stuck in the "down" position. This happens when there is not enough pressure to move the lever (the "pedal") up or down.	oncogenes	How is oncogenes like car accelerator stuck in down position?
Car brakes work to keep the car on the road by creating a brake pad. Tumor suppressor genes work in quite a different way- they help your body make sure that tumors don’t grow too big, and when they do, their impact is minimal. This means that if you have a tumor in your brain or spine, it won’t ever get out of control and cause problems for you.	tumor suppressor genes	How is tumor suppressor genes like car brakes?
Tumor suppressors are genes that stop the growth of tumors. They are usually found in the ABCG2 gene, which is located on the chromosome 22. This gene controls how your body produces some types of cells, including cancerous cells. When this gene is mutated, it can make it difficult for the cancer to grow and spread.	tumor suppressor genes	How is tumor suppressor genes like car brakes?
Tumor suppressors are genes that reduce the expression of tumors. Car brakes work by preventing the release of energy from your car, which would cause it to go into reverse and hit someone. The same thing happens with tumor suppressor genes–they keep them from expressed, which means they don’t do anything to stop anycancer from arising.	tumor suppressor genes	How is tumor suppressor genes like car brakes?
Tumor suppressors are genes that reduce the expression of cancerous cells. They do this by controlling how enzymes work in a person's body, which can make it difficult for tumors to grow.	tumor suppressor genes	How is tumor suppressor genes like car brakes?
Car brakes are vehicles that use a system to apply pressure on the wheel in order to stop the car. This is done by using solenoids and electromagnets, which create electric fields that interact with each other.

In a dark room, the light from the star shining down on the object is what makes things visible. The same thing happens with waves in a physical world. When you look at an ocean wave, for example, there are minutes and hours of long-term variation in height and intensity that can be seen features on the surface of the wave such as troughs and peaks.	wave mechanical model	How is wave mechanical model like firefly in a dark room?
When you look at a wave, it is composed of tiny Ichor particles. When the current passes through these objects, they cause an electric field to develop within the ICHOR. This electric field attracts small fireflies like electrons and represents how light behaves in waves.	wave mechanical model	How is wave mechanical model like firefly in a dark room?
The wave mechanical model is like a firefly in a dark room. The firefly emits and receives light and heat, just like an electric current does.	wave mechanical model	How is wave mechanical model like firefly in a dark room?
A wave mechanical model looks like a firefly in a dark room. The flame of the firefly is attracted to magnets on the floor and it flashes back and forth as it moves. This is how waves move in the ocean when they travel along its surface.	wave mechanical model	How is wave mechanical model like firefly in a dark room?
There is no direct answer to this question because fireflies are different based on their environment and waves can be very differently designed in order to replicate specific environments. Ultimately, it all comes down to how you want your wave machine to behave - if you want a simplistic design with few variables then the firefly model may work just fine. If you want something that behaves more realistically and realistically replicates the environment then the wave mechanical model will likely do a better job.	wave mechanical model	How is wave mechanical model like firefly in a dark room?
An electroencephalogram (EEG) measures the electrical activity of the brain. Electroencephalography is usually used to track patterns of brain waves, which can indicate mood orStatus epilepticus reactivation point in a seizure patient EEGWhen someone is having a seizure, their EEG will be abnormal. This means that there are high levels of electricity flowing through their brains and it can be difficult to understand what's happening because the signals are so scrambled.	electroencephalogram	How is electroencephalogram like listening to a game?
An electroencephalogram (EEG) typically reveals the electrical activity of the brain.

dna replication is like a photocopier machine where the output of one run is used as the input for another.	dna replication	How is dna replication like photocopier machine?
 DNA replication is like photocopying. Copycats copy the same letters of the alphabet to make other copies of themselves. The originals keep their identity and remain unchanged, while the copied items become imitation objects that can be used or abused.	dna replication	How is dna replication like photocopier machine?
Dna replication is like a photocopier machine. When you print out a document, the ink is spread evenly over the pages and preserves the text's layout while creating copies that are exact duplicates of each other.	dna replication	How is dna replication like photocopier machine?
Dna replication is a process by which DNA copies are made. This can be done through either mitosis (a consecutive division of the chromosomes into two types), or meiosis (the splitting of one sex cell into two).	dna replication	How is dna replication like photocopier machine?
Dna replication is verysimilar to photocopying. A photocopy machine prints a copy of the document on paper. The same process happens when two people replicating their DNA: they print out an exact replica of each other's genetic material using a printing press.	dna replication	How is dna replication like photocopier machine?
Book printing is a manual process where the order of book pages is determined by hand. The printed books are then bound together with clamps, and finished with an acidic solution that turns the ink into stories.	dna replication	How is dna replication like book printing?
The printing process of a book is very different than the replication process of DNA. Book printers print one page at a time, while DNA replication involves breaking down large pieces of DNA into smaller pieces and then reassembling them back together like piecing puzzles.	dna replication	How is dna replication like book printing?
Dna replication is like book printing. The replicated DNA is isolated from the original DNA and then mixed together to create a chromosome mixture. This mix is then heated until it becomes molten, which causes the chromosomes to migrate towards the center of the melted mixture. Once they are close to the center, the chromosomes are pinned down with hot chemicals and ultraviolet light, which creates copies of each chromosome in that area.	dna replication	How is dna replication like book printing?
Dna replication is very similar to book printing. The dna are replicated using a sort of process called allele exchange. This involves borrowing one set of dna from another organism, and then swapping the positions of certain sequences within the copied dna so that they match perfectly.	dna replication	How is dna replication like book printing?
Book printing is the print process of making copies of books by using a press. Dna replication is not as simple as book printing, because DNA does not need to be printed like text. Instead, replicated pieces of dna are put together (using robots or other technology) and then cut into small pieces that can be mailed to recipients.	dna replication	How is dna replication like book printing?
Both RNA transcription and language translation involve translating mRNA into proteins. Transcription is the process of converting a small number of dna molecules called RNAs into protein form. Translation is the process of making these proteins available to be used by cells or organisms.	rna transcription	How is rna transcription like language translation?
Rna transcription is like a language translation because it is able to faithfully reproduce the sounds of one language and translate them into another. For example, in English, "I" can be pronounced as "ie", "you" can be pronounced as "yoo-uhs", and so on. Those three examples are just some of the many sound combinations that rna transcription can recreate.	rna transcription	How is rna transcription like language translation?
RNA transcription is very similar to language translation. The process of translating one set of information into another is made up of a series of steps, each involving an appropriate organelle in the plant or animal cell. RNA transcription also involves a sequence of chemical reactions that result in the formation of mRNA (or other organic molecules).	rna transcription	How is rna transcription like language translation?
Rna transcription is a process of translating RNA into words. The RNAs in the cells are chopped up into small pieces and put together like sentences. Then, someone who knows how to read between the lines reads the sentence and understands it.	rna transcription	How is rna transcription like language translation?
Rna transcription is like a translation of language. It helps to convert one form of text into another form.	rna transcription	How is rna transcription like language translation?
Protein translation is a four-step process that starts with the initiation of protein synthesis and culminates in the assembly of the translated protein. In language translation, each step occurs independently, but always together in an organized order.	protein translation	How is protein translation like language translation?
Protein translation is like a conversation between two people. One person translated the words from one language into another, while the other person listened and nodded along. Then, they acted on what was said and corrected any errors.	protein translation	How is protein translation like language translation?
 Protein translation is very similar to how language translation works. The process of translating a word or phrase into the correct amino acid sequence is done by using an enzyme called ribosomal peptide synthetase (RPS), which catalyzes the addition of one sugar molecule, usually glucose, to a protein chain in the reverse direction.	protein translation	How is protein translation like language translation?
 feds defines protein translation as the process of translating a set of codons, or building blocks, into an amino acid sequence in the cell's genetic code. Translation is carried out by RNA molecules that travel betweenthe cytoplasm and the nucleus.	protein translation	How is protein translation like language translation?
Protein translation is like a dialogue between the ribosome and the messenger RNA. The ribosome assembles new amino acids from precursors in the mRNA, then Secretes them into lysates (a type of protein). This process can take anywhere from minutes to days. Once the transcript has been translated into an executable form, it's released by the proteasome and transported across cell membranes for degradation.	protein translation	How is protein translation like language translation?
Ecosystem is considered as a community of living things and their environment. In cannibals, the ecosystem includes all animals within a certain radius, including those that feed on other animals or scavenge for food. The term has been used to describe cities too, with some defining them as “a complex web ofphysical and social elements” (Dixon-Greenberg).	ecosystem	How is ecosystem like cities?
In general, ecosystems are like cities. Both have an elemental mix of living things and nonliving things. The two differ in one important respect: the environment in which a city operates is typically more positive than that of an ecosystem. Cities rely on human ingenuity to create ways for objects and people to interact with each other and the natural world, whereas ecosystems do not have as much of a need for humans.	ecosystem	How is ecosystem like cities?
The city is a type of ecosystem because it has physical and human-made features that interact with one another. The city can be divided into two types: the innercity and theoutercity. The innercity is where most of the population lives, while the outercity is where most of the jobs are located.	ecosystem	How is ecosystem like cities?
Ecosystem is a network of living things and their physical environment. The term can be used to describe the way we interact with our planet, as well as how we create and maintain our own societies.	ecosystem	How is ecosystem like cities?
Ecosystems are communities of living organisms and tissues that interact with their environment. They can be found in both the wild and laboratory settings, but they share some common features. For example, ecosystems include plants, animals, bacteria, fungi, and other microbes; water resources (e.g., rivers, lakes); energy sources (wind or solar power); and land resources ( trees, bushes, etc.).	ecosystem	How is ecosystem like cities?
The propagation of an action potential down a neuron is like the falling dominoes. Every time a neuron cellfires, some tiny bit of energy (plasma) is released. This plasma then travels through the neuron's axon to other cells in its brain and body and clockwise back up the dendrite until it arrives at another neuron cell. The next time that THIS Cell fires, more plasmático power will be released and that Anime will continue polling throughout your neurons life cycle!	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	How is propagation of an action potential down a neuron like falling dominoes?
The propagation of an action potential down a neuron is like falling dominoes. The first dominoes to fall are the myelin cells that contribute energy to the current. Then, the vesicle containing ions (such as potassium) and neurotransmitters (such as serotonin) falls. Finally, the membrane opens up and allow all other neurons in the cell to translate these signals into electrical activity.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	How is propagation of an action potential down a neuron like falling dominoes?
The propagation of an action potential down a neuron is like the fall of dominoes. Theneral membrane potential (P) changes as the cells send and receive electrical impulses. When there is an impulse, some protons (H+) escape from the neuron's interior and travel up the P-channel currentpath to neighbouring neurons in a process called depolarization. Other protons (L+ or Na+, D+) remain within the neuron and traveldownstream along either AChR conductances or voltage-gated ion channels to other cells inthe network.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	How is propagation of an action potential down a neuron like falling dominoes?
A neuron's action potential is like a Falling dominoes. It propagates down the neuron like an avalanche.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	How is propagation of an action potential down a neuron like falling dominoes?
This analogy is inaccurate because it suggests that the propagation of an action potential down a neuron is like the distribution of dominoes. It's more accurate to think of it as spreadsheets with many pieces falling at once.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	How is propagation of an action potential down a neuron like falling dominoes?
The breathing mechanism of frogs is like blowing of the balloon. When a frog inhales, its lungs contract and push air into their stomach which in turn creates pressure inside the individual's mouth and these pushing forces cause the Frog's palate to come in contact with teeth as it sucks in air. The pressurized gas then escapes from individual frog's lungs through an opening at the back end known as buccal or aboral port	breathing mechanism of frogs	How is breathing mechanism of frogs like blowing of the balloon?

The frog's air bladder is inflated with air and then the top of the bladder is cut off, so thatived it in a way that brings in fresh air into the mouth and lungs. When this process is repeated often enough, an individual Frog can breathe through their nose	breathing mechanism of frogs	How is breathing mechanism of frogs like blowing of the balloon?
The breathing mechanism of frogs is like blowing of the balloon. When a frog blows its air into its mouth, it creates an inflation in the lungs which forces water and air up into their respiratory system where they are used to breathe.	breathing mechanism of frogs	How is breathing mechanism of frogs like blowing of the balloon?
Layer 1: Language translation. Layer 2: The user's understanding of the translated text.  Layer 3: The interpretation or representation of that text in front of the translator.	layered architecture	How is layered architecture like communication with translators?
Layered architecture usually refers to the way that a system communicates with translators. In layered architectures, different layers communicate with each other in order to provide multiple translations of messages and requests. This allows for an efficient communication between different parts of the system. Additionally, this provides a structure within which users can develop more complex applications by creating interrelated translation models that are tailored specifically to their needs.	layered architecture	How is layered architecture like communication with translators?
Layer architecture is similar to communication with translators. You send a message and the translator translates it into the language you want to speak.	layered architecture	How is layered architecture like communication with translators?

Each layer can provide a different perspective or interpretation of the preceding layer, and so on up until the underlying system is fully interpreted.	layered architecture	How is layered architecture like communication with translators?
Layer 1: Translators translate the user's text into another language. Layer 2: The translator creates an image or model of the original text and stores it in a database. This template can be used by other software to generate translations for reuse.	layered architecture	How is layered architecture like communication with translators?
Chocolate comes in many different flavors, some of which are stronger than others. Some chocolate factories have limits on how much reactant they can put into a batch and still make the same quality flavor chocolate. Other factories may add more reactant to create a desired flavor but keep the overall quality consistent.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	How is limiting reactant and excess reactant like chocolate distribution?
In a chocolate distribution system, the use of relatively small and often uniform controlled volumes allowsmolasses to flow smoothly through the beaker while minimizing turbulence. The large surface area of molasses provides constant stirring, which ensures that all particles in the mixture are stirred equally. Inversely, when heavy or specialty oils are used in chocolate production, they can cause pockets of hot oil to form on top of the molten mass due to high boiling points. To avoid this problem, it is important to monitor the temperature at which different oils have reached their Top Shelf Temperature (TST) before making any decisions about how much oil will be added to a batch.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	How is limiting reactant and excess reactant like chocolate distribution?
Chocolate is distributed in two ways: through the air and on the tongue. The air distribution of chocolate is due to its structure - it consists of cocoa butter, sugar, cream and vanilla extract. The tongues distribution of chocolate happens when people lick their lips after eating it. Chocolate moves down the throat (through buccal passage) and into the intestines where it combines with other products in your intestine before being released as stool	limiting reactant and excess reactant	How is limiting reactant and excess reactant like chocolate distribution?
When two substances are in contact with each other, they will start to react. The reactions can be slow or quick, but the end result is always something that appears on the surface of the mixture. Reactant and excess reactant are both examples of this type of mixture. In chocolate distribution, limiting reactant means controlling how many grams of cocoa flavour concentrate you add to every liter of water while keeping the total concentration high enough so that no undesired compounds form (too low a concentration would allow for bitterness). Excess reactant means adding more cocoa flavor concentrate than necessary to make sure that all ingredients are evenly mixed and there is no off-flavor present.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	How is limiting reactant and excess reactant like chocolate distribution?
Chocolate is distributed in a boiling liquid form. When it cools, it solidifies and becomes a bar or ball of chocolate. The particles in the chocolate are small and they move around so much that some get to other parts of the bottle and others stay put where they were before. This movement ofparticles causes collisions between them which create heat as they vaporize water molecule by molecule	limiting reactant and excess reactant	How is limiting reactant and excess reactant like chocolate distribution?
Eukaryotic cells like to use energy source, such as glucose and oxygen, to produce ATP. This energy is turned into work by the cell's enzyme system.

limiting reactant is like drinking coffee granules. When you swallow them, they dissolve in your stomach and travel down to your intestines where they break down into energy and water. This process of breaking down food into its component parts – such as sugar and amino acids – is what helps you feel full after eating.	limiting reactant	How is limiting reactant like a cup of coffee granules?
limiting reactant is similar to spilling coffee in a pot - it's an easy way to make a mess and drainage can be difficult. You need to use a fair amount of waterensity (water capacity) when measuring the bowl, not just enough so that the liquid is pourable but not too much that it creates problems with overflow or flooding.	limiting reactant	How is limiting reactant like a cup of coffee granules?
Limiting reactant is like milling coffee beans. The more reactants there are, the different color and flavor will be (since each reactant produces a specific chemical reaction).  To get a desired result, tiny amounts of many reactants are needed to produce the desired effect.	limiting reactant	How is limiting reactant like a cup of coffee granules?
One way reactant limits is through the use of a pot or other means to limit contact with air.

Message encoding is like speaking. The person sending the message and the receivers receiving it use different languages to communicate. When a communication system emerged that allowed for messages to be encoded in multiple ways, unique code combinations were needed for each type of transmission. This led to the development of typography, which was used to create individual letterforms across all language types so that a message could be read with ease regardless of its representation format.	message encoding	How is message encoding like speaking?
Message encoding is like speaking. The first step in message encoding is to create a set of tokens that can be interpreted as words. This process can be done by manipulating the characters that make up a language's spoken language. For example, English uses letters and sounds to encode messages, while Spanish does not. Once the words have been created, they need to be translated into an appropriate character set for transmission over a communications channel or system. In order for a computer or phone to understand what you are saying, it needs to contain all of the correct letters and sound patterns corresponding to those used in your spoken language. The most common type of communication binary code (encoded text) is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). This format was developed by American Bureau of Standards in 1928 and standardized by USENIX in 1987	message encoding	How is message encoding like speaking?
When a person speaks, they use their vocal cords to produce speech. When encoding an e-mail, the user's software uses coding to create individual messages into groups that are easier to read and understand. Different UCSD students might encode different types of information using different methods depending on what type of message it is - For example, one student might encode pictures or videos asBase64 strings while another may encode text in UTF-8.	message encoding	How is message encoding like speaking?
Message encoding is like speaking. You produce a stream of words by saying one or more pieces of information and then transmitting the resulting signal over a medium such as voice Codecs, video Codecs, digital Signal Processors (DSP), etc.	message encoding	How is message encoding like speaking?
Message encoding is like speaking. You use phonetic symbols to represent sounds in text. These symbols are called letters and they are placed into sequence, or blocks, to create sentences.	message encoding	How is message encoding like speaking?
When two drugs bind to a receptor, they form an "antiferromagnetic sandwich." This means that the drug tries to grab onto one side of the occupied site and the metal ions on that site try to pull away from each other. So if you put something like metal foil over the exposed end of a key, it will electrochemically shield that metal so no Drugs can attach themselves and cause problems.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	How is interaction between drugs and receptor sites like lock and key?
A lock and key analogy would be to say that the interaction between drugs and receptor sites is like a lock on a door. The Drugs interact with receptors in the membrane of cells, which in turn activate proteins that create an electrical current (the action potential). This current helps to Q-tip through channels into cells, allowing the drug to do its job!	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	How is interaction between drugs and receptor sites like lock and key?
The interaction between drugs and receptor sites is like lock and key. The drug binds to the receptor site, but the receptor does not bind back to the drug. This allows the drug to enter into contact with the target cells, which can activate them.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	How is interaction between drugs and receptor sites like lock and key?
Drugs interact with receptor sites in a variety of different ways.lock and key analogy is useful for understanding this interaction. A lock resembles a set of keys, which allow the user to open the door of their house. The same goes for receptors; these are sets of proteins that allow drugs to interact with them. Drugs can "lock" onto receptor sites by binding to specific sequences on the protein, and then staying put (or "locking") until they are released again.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	How is interaction between drugs and receptor sites like lock and key?
The interaction between drugs and receptor sites is like a lock and key. The drug binds to the receptor site, which then projects an electrical signal that the neuron can hear. The same thing happens with neurotransmitters, which are released by neurons in response to either environmental stimuli or internal signals.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	How is interaction between drugs and receptor sites like lock and key?
The interaction between drugs and receptor sites is like foot fitting in footprint. The drug's chemical structure fits onto the receptor site, and then the binding event happens.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	How is interaction between drugs and receptor sites like foot fitting in footprint?
The interaction between drugs and receptor sites is like foot fitting in footprint. Drug binding to the receptor site creates apocket of space within the skin that is filled with drug, which then binds to other receptors on neighboring cells. This process can continue until all of the drug has been absorbed into the blood or tissue.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	How is interaction between drugs and receptor sites like foot fitting in footprint?
Receptor sites are not like foot fitting in footprint. Drug interactions involve the substances that bind to receptor sites and the proteins that help these substances work. When a drug binds to one of these proteins, it creates a physical bond between the drug and this protein. This bond can be weaken by other factors, such as environmental temperature or moisture fluctuations, so scientists have to be very careful when trying to study how drugs interact with receptors. Footfitting is an example of how researchers use mathematical models to understand how Drugs interact with receptors in detail.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	How is interaction between drugs and receptor sites like foot fitting in footprint?
This is a difficult question. It seems that drugs and receptor sites interact in a way that provides the best fit for foot prints when measurements are taken at different points on the body.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	How is interaction between drugs and receptor sites like foot fitting in footprint?
The way that drugs and receptors interact is complicated, but usually one drug will bind to a receptor site on another person's foot. The receptor sites are eventually shared by the two people, so the interaction between these drugs and receptors happens primarily at this point.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	How is interaction between drugs and receptor sites like foot fitting in footprint?

There is no specific consensus on how ram resembles pre-frontal lobe. Somesay that it behaves much like the frontal cortex of humans, while others claim that it lacks some of the crucial functionality found in human prefrontal cortices. Furthermore, there is still considerable disagreement as to whether or not ram develops during development or if it simply persists through adulthood.	ram	How is ram like pre-frontal lobe?
 RAM is like the pre-frontal lobe in that it governs behavior and thought.	ram	How is ram like pre-frontal lobe?
The frontal lobe is missing in most cases, leaving the brain with a mixture of lobes. Some people say that ram looks something like pre-frontal lobe because it has an enlarged thalamus (a part of the brain responsible for memory and reason), a large hippocampus (an arearesponsible for learning new things), and relatively few neurons in other parts of the brain.	ram	How is ram like pre-frontal lobe?
There is some debate about whether or not ram is like the pre-frontal lobe of the brain. While there are similarities, it's still unclear exactly how they work together. If you compare a human’s frontal cortex – which makes up most of your thinking and decision making skills – to a crocodile’s brain, you would say that humans have more in common with cats than they do with crocodiles. However, the way that these brains process information isn't fully understood either - so we can't say for sure if ram has anything similar at all to what happens in the prefrontal cortex of a human.	ram	How is ram like pre-frontal lobe?
Ram is similar to the pre-frontal lobe in that it helps with cognitive functions. However, ram is also responsible for sensory processing and motor function.	ram	How is ram like pre-frontal lobe?

The age of a tree is calculated by adding the number of years it has lived to the total number of years on Earth.	tree's age calculation	How is tree's age calculation like coral's age calculation?
Two similar calculations are tree's age calculation and coral's age calculation. First, the tree is divided into growth stages: pre-heartwood, post-heartwood, and Crown Collemnage. Next, the ages of each stage are determined based on how long it took for that particular stage to grow. Finally, the total number of years in each growth period is calculated and summed together to determine the chronological age of a tree.	tree's age calculation	How is tree's age calculation like coral's age calculation?
Trees grow, and decay over time. This is because the tree's cells are replaced by new ones as the tree grows older. Compare this to coral, which dies without replacement due to natural calcification (a process that happens when calcium levels in a water droplet increase).	tree's age calculation	How is tree's age calculation like coral's age calculation?
Trees are typically measured in years, with the first year being the planting date and any subsequent years going downhill by one month. This is because coral lives for a certain number of years after it is planted, while trees can live up to 3 or 4 hundred years. To calculate tree's age, simply add together all of the ages of each individual tree (peak height/bp, average life span), then divide that result by the number of years it has been alive	tree's age calculation	How is tree's age calculation like coral's age calculation?
The age of a tree is calculated by adding the length of time it has been alive (the number of years since its creation) to the average life expectancy of different types of trees.	tree's age calculation	How is tree's age calculation like coral's age calculation?
If you are asking how roller coasters work, the answer is that they have a hill on one side and a valley on the other. The coaster goes up and down in these valleys, which gives it an adrenaline rush. Glycolysis is just like this - it also has hills but special proteins called glycoproteins help to control its speed.	glycolysis	How is glycolysis like roller coaster?
A roller coaster is a rides that have hills and curves. This also applies to glycolysis, which is like a ride on a Roller Coaster where you go up and down.	glycolysis	How is glycolysis like roller coaster?
Roller coaster riders go on a journey down the track, experiencing various speeds and turns. Glycolysis is like this too- passengers experience different levels of intensity as they ride.	glycolysis	How is glycolysis like roller coaster?
When you go on a roller coaster, the train goes up and down. This is what happens when you break down glycogen into glucose and pyruvate.	glycolysis	How is glycolysis like roller coaster?
When you ride on a Roller Coaster, the first few times you go up and then come down, it feels like you're going at really fast speeds. But as you keep riding, the speed changes more and more so that it looks like you're slowly building up your speed until suddenly - BOOM! You go soaring up again. This is how glycolysis works too: when we break down glucose by breaking it down into sugar molecules (using Glycolysis), our body continues to use those sugar molecules to create energy.	glycolysis	How is glycolysis like roller coaster?
The way anti-stokes scattering behaves is very much like ball striking a plate. The scattering of particles increases as the randomness of their positioning decreases.	anti-stokes scattering	How is anti-stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?
When you hit a ball with your hand, the force of the strike is spread out in all directions. This is also true for anti-stokes scattering. When you hit a particle with an electric field, it will scatter the light in all directions according to its mass and speed.	anti-stokes scattering	How is anti-stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?
The scattered particles of an anti-stokes scattering experiment will be perpendicular to the Creek. This is because the electrons in a material scatter perpendicularly, as shown in Figure 1C below.	anti-stokes scattering	How is anti-stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?
It is like a ball striking a plate. The object (ball) willChina some scattered material along its path. This includes the air that was in contact with the ball when it hit the ground, as well as any material on the surface of the plate where the impact happened.	anti-stokes scattering	How is anti-stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?
The scatter of light is like a ball striking a plate. The scattered light will be in different directions depending on how close the object was to the lens and also how fast the ball was moving.	anti-stokes scattering	How is anti-stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?
If you hit a ball with your hand, the ball will rebound off the table and into your palm. The same is true when you throw an object. If you put a certain amount of force into it, it will go farther than if you didn't use any arm power at all. That's why balls on hardwood floors scatter more then other types of surfaces - because harder materials bounce more than softly-surfaced ones.	stokes scattering	How is stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?
When two materials are moving in opposite directions at high speed, they cause Friction. This is what causes the plate to move slightly as if it was struck by a rubber ball. The same thing happens when two gases interact with each other: the particles inside the gas become more numerous than those outside of it. In this situation, too, we call these interactions scattering (from Latin scatula meaning 'to scratch'). When two small objects like balls or pieces of paper hit one another head-on, some bits of both objects get scattered away and ended up on different sides of the object collision - such as on either side of your hand when you try to push a ball off a table). On a much smaller scale, all micrometers Agreement between them can create simple waves called Electrons in an atom which scatter short(distant) photons from greater distance units called shells and Molecules	stokes scattering	How is stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?
The stokes scattering process depends on the material that is being scattered. If a metal object is being scattered, then there will be an upward scatter of the photons and an downward scatter of the electrons. The angle at which these scatters are perpendicular to each other will determine how effectively the photon or electron energy is converted into diffracted light.	stokes scattering	How is stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?
If you drop a piece of metal on an inclined surface, such as a stovetop, the metal will scatter in all directions. If you hit another piece of metal on top of the first, some pieces of the first will hit the Second and then wander off into different directions. This is how stokes scattering looks like: some bits of gas or dust particles are scattered to every direction by impacts with other objects.	stokes scattering	How is stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?
Stokes scattering is like ball striking a plate. The scattered light changes in intensity as it travels away from the object that made the impact. This is why you can't see anything near an exploding firearm when fired, because the scatter become too numerous for your eyes to process.	stokes scattering	How is stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?
 MEDIAN lethal dose is theminimum amount of radiation that will kill a human.	median lethal dose	How is median lethal dose like balls and target?
Median lethal dose is a measure of the average amount that a poison can kill someone. It is like balls and targets, where each ball has a different size and shape. The smaller the ball, the more damage it can do to someone. The larger the target, the less damage it can do.	median lethal dose	How is median lethal dose like balls and target?
The median lethal dose like balls and target is the most common way to measure how much impact a given projectile has. The ball is hit at a high speed by an object with a large mass, such as a rifle bullet. This causes molecular disrupters in the air that scatter the projectiles into many small pieces. A human body takes up almost half of an average rifle round's weight, so even though each fragment slows down the bullet's journey to its destination, it still creates enough havoc that one person can kill multiple people with just one shot from close range.	median lethal dose	How is median lethal dose like balls and target?
The median lethal dose (MLD) is the amount that kills 50% of a nominate population. It is calculated by dividing the kill rate for a particular species of prey by thePopulation size at risk. The MLD for any given animal can be quite different, depending on its natural habitats and Diet. For example,the LD50 of an Indian mongoose is around 2.5 kg while theLD50 of a red fox is only 0.1 mg/kg	median lethal dose	How is median lethal dose like balls and target?
There is no one answer to this question since it depends on the particular animal in question and how similar their physiology is to human physiology. However, median lethal dose can be used as a rough approximation for comparing different types of munitions. For example, if a projectile has a median lethal dose of 10 milliliters (mg/kg), then its effective range would be about 100 meters (300 feet). Similarly, if an attacker had just enough time to fire a shotgun round that could kill another person at the same distance with a 95% chance of doing so, then his death would likely occur within seconds.	median lethal dose	How is median lethal dose like balls and target?

 Enzyme is an enzyme like lock and key where the active site is a molecule that binds to another molecule. The inactive site is the molecule that bound to the enzyme before it became active.	enzyme mechanism	How is enzyme mechanism like lock and key?
Enzyme mechanism looks like a lock and key. Enzymes are proteins that catalyze chemical reactions in the body. When one of the enzymes is activated, it causes another protein to respond by complexing with it so that they can work together in synergy. This “lock” prevents other molecules from entering or leaving the cell while the enzyme continues its reaction.	enzyme mechanism	How is enzyme mechanism like lock and key?
 Enzyme mechanism is like lock and key. The enzymatic process begins with the binding of an enzyme to its substrate. This interaction causes a change in the target protein's chemical composition, which allows the enzyme to catalyze Productions Categorized as:Nonprotein Chemicals	enzyme mechanism	How is enzyme mechanism like lock and key?
The enzyme mechanism is like a lock and key. The lock works by metal pressing against the inside of the keyhole, which in turn makes it possible for you to open the door.

Chemical equilibrium is the balance between two substances in an environment. In a dam and lake, water levels are regulated by how much material is streaming into and out of the rising or falling body, while chemical equilibrium depends on how many different chemicals are present in each space.	chemical equilibrium	How is chemical equilibrium like water level in dam and lake?
Chemical equilibrium is like water level in a dam or lake. The higher the concentration of one substance in a container, the lower its concentration will be in another container with the same volume.	chemical equilibrium	How is chemical equilibrium like water level in dam and lake?
Water level in a dam orlake is controlled by the weight of water on the dam and by how much water flows into it from surrounding rivers. The equilibrium between the outside pressure and the inside pressure of the liquid water is maintained through an adjustment process that adjusts to changing conditions.	chemical equilibrium	How is chemical equilibrium like water level in dam and lake?
The chemical equilibrium of a liquid is the point at which the ingredients in that liquid are balanced so that no one element is more dominant than any other. This happens when pressures and temperature gradients within the liquid cause molecules to move from areas with high concentration to those with lower concentration.	chemical equilibrium	How is chemical equilibrium like water level in dam and lake?
The water in a dam or lake is constant because the water has been flowed into and through it from the surrounding land. The pressure inside the dam or lake is also constant, since all of the water at one point was put there by humans.	chemical equilibrium	How is chemical equilibrium like water level in dam and lake?

Adaptive immunity, or being able to quickly and effectively resist a virus or infection, is similar to police headquerters. Officers are trained in how to use the latest methods of protection against crime, such as looking for suspects and tracking down clues. This information is shared with other officers who are alsotrained in how to best deal with the suspect or clue.	adaptive immunity	How is adaptive immunity like police headquerters?
Adaptive immunity is conferred by the body's natural defenses that work together to fight infection. When an infection happens, the immune system sets off a reaction in which white blood cells (cells that help fight infections) swarm into the area and attack the infected cell. This action destroys any infected cells and helps to protect against future infections.	adaptive immunity	How is adaptive immunity like police headquerters?
Adaptive immunity is the response of a person to environmental or infectious factors.

Transcription is like photocopying. A copy of a document is made, and then the text of the document is copied over. The TEXT OF THE DOCUMENT can be changed if desired (such as in a research paper), but the COPY will still have all the original formatting.	transcription	How is transcription like photocopying?
Transcription is a process of copying text from an original document. The transcriptionist begins byVOI transcribing the vocal cords into ASCII, which is a type of keyboard code that represents individual speech sounds. They then add spaces to each occurrence of the Vocabulary Break, and place punctuation marks around all words in the text. This completes the transcription process by creating a list of channel-like transcripts where every word appears as follows: The final step in transcription is to combine these channels into one file with appropriately timed gaps between them so that all sound data are combined into one "voice."	transcription	How is transcription like photocopying?

 Biological signal transduction is like threat communication in animals. A biological response can depend on the presence of a molecule that catalyzes a chemical reaction, such as adrenaline or optokinetic responses in vertebrates. When something activates these receptors, an electrical current flows through the nerve and thence to other parts of the body. This current can cause muscles to contract, change blood flow (angina), or release hormones.	biological signal transduction	How is biological signal transduction like threat communication in animals?
The way biological signals are communicated in animals is by transmitter molecules releasing chemicals that identify the location and type of threat. The receiving animal then sends a signal back to the sender that confirms or denies the presence of the Threat.	biological signal transduction	How is biological signal transduction like threat communication in animals?
Biological signal transduction is a process by which cells in an animal send messages to each other through the use of hormones.
