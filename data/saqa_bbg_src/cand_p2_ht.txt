The body's first line of defense against disease is its ability to break down and digest food. The process of breaking down a nutritious meal takes energy from the bloodstream, which in turn helps the body resist infection. In order for an individual toabsor all the nutrients they need from food, their intestines have to work extremely quickly- this is why it can take some time before someone feels hungry. In atp, however, that speed has been decreased because atp doesn't use as much energy when eating -- instead, it breaks down complex carbohydrates like glucose and fructose into simple molecules called monomers. This helped us lose weight because we weren't trying to absorb so many calories by breaking them down into simpler form."	atp	Explain how atp is like ready to eat food.

 Voltage is like a staircase. When you step on the first stair, the voltage in your shoe points up. This continues as you walk up the stairs, until at the top of each step there's a dead end. If you were to try and ascend any further, your shoes would no longer have enough voltage to keep going, and you'd trip and fall down the stairs.	voltage	Explain how voltage is like climbing a staircase.
A staircase is like a voltage. Voltage is the force that power goes through wires to make things work. staircases have up and down stairs, which makes them think of themselves as levels or steps. The higher you go, the more power it takes to move the same amount of weight up those stairs so you can get back down again - this is what happens with electricity when people use it to climb stairs: they take less and less Electricity every time they ascend because their muscles are getting weaker and weakening as they go up. If someone had 30 volts coming into their body at every step (the voltage on an electric cord) then at each landing there would be a 30 volt difference between each step! But because somebody's muscle has been weakened by all of that Electricity simply taking smaller and smaller Volts until it peters out Charisma wouldn't be able to help them negotiate these small differences in voltage - instead, they would fall over!	voltage	Explain how voltage is like climbing a staircase.

The same is true with voltage - it's always going around and helping us move forward when we have it.	voltage	Explain how voltage is like climbing a staircase.
 Voltage is like climbing a staircase. You have an electric current going up the stairs and then turning around at a higher voltage (the top). This turns off the electricity in the current, which makes it go back down to your level. The same thing happens with pressure: you have an atmospheric pressure going up and then turning around at a higher pressure (the bottom). This causes the air outside of your body to push against the inside of your blood vessels, causing them to burst or close. Finally, when you reach the top of the staircase, there's still some voltage left in the current because it has turned around at another higher voltage!	voltage	Explain how voltage is like climbing a staircase.
The football analogy is useful for illustrating how specialization and communication in a cell are like the sport of football.

When you hike, your muscles push the air up a hill. The same thing is going on when you press down on a conducting object like an electrode in a lab experiment. This action increases the Voltage across that object and causes it to amplify or increase in strength. Kirchoff's Voltage law states that this amplified voltage will continue to grow as the distance between objects gets greater.	kirchoff's voltage law	Explain how kirchoff's voltage law is like hiking.
A voltage law is a set of instructions that tells you how much electricity flows in one direction and out the other. Kirchoff's Voltage Law says that when you hold an electric charge (like a battery) against something else, it squeezes the liquid inside the battery so tightly that the voltage between the two surfaces starts to rise. This increase in pressure closes off some of the paths for energy to flow from one side of the battery to the other, reducing current flow.	kirchoff's voltage law	Explain how kirchoff's voltage law is like hiking.
There is a lot of hiking in kirchoff's voltage law. The law states that the voltage across an electric circuit will increase as you go up the electrical supply path.	kirchoff's voltage law	Explain how kirchoff's voltage law is like hiking.
Kirchoff's voltage law is the basic principle behind hiking. Hiking uses a higher gradient than walking, which causes the electric potential difference between two points on an object to increase as they move closer together. This principle can be applied in many ways, including when measuring voltage differences in circuits and assembling electrical components.	kirchoff's voltage law	Explain how kirchoff's voltage law is like hiking.
The voltage law is like hiking. You are always trying to maintain a certain level of force (v) in your muscle by using weight (w). This explains why you feel the need to hike uphill, because each extra meter of elevation added will add required power (V = w/2), or alternatively you can use momentum (P) to keep up with the hills. The same principle applies to electricity; it's just that volts are measured in wattage and amps are measured in wattspeak or current draw.	kirchoff's voltage law	Explain how kirchoff's voltage law is like hiking.

The human active memory system is like a computer. The main difference between the two systems is that a computer stores data in hard-coded locations, while a human's memory gardens information through private shortcuts. For example, when you are looking at a picture of your cat, your brain keeps track of how many times it has been viewed and compares this number to the number of pictures in your photo album. If the average amount of view time for each picture in your photo album is 5 minutes, then the brain will remember that you looked at 1/5th of all pictures in the album before seeing this one and compare that to remembering that you had counted 12 pictures with an average total viewing time of 30 minutes!	human active memory system	Explain how human active memory system is like computer.

Tumor suppressor genes are like car brakes, in that they help to stop the growth of cancer cells by controlling how muchentially these cells can reproduce.	tumor suppressor genes	Explain how tumor suppressor genes is like car brakes.
Tumor suppressor genes are like car brakes in that they help to halt growth of tumors. The function of tumor suppressor genes is to keep cells from multiplying too much, which can lead to cancer. Car brakes work by cutting off the flow of energy to the vehicle's motor, so if there is a lot of energy coming in then it will not run as quickly and therefore the car will be slowed down. Tumor suppressors also have another role - they can help to prevent cancers from spreading through the body.	tumor suppressor genes	Explain how tumor suppressor genes is like car brakes.
When you drive a car, the car's brakes work to stop the vehicle. The brake system uses hydraulics to apply pressure to different areas of the wheel in order to slow the car down. Car brakes use tumor suppressor genes as signals sent from these hydraulic systems to other parts of the brain that control movement and breathing. This way, if there is a tumor on someone's cells, it will not grow because this signaling will not continue.	tumor suppressor genes	Explain how tumor suppressor genes is like car brakes.
Tumor suppressor genes are like car brakes. When they work, they keep the growth of cancer in check. But because these genes have a fate independent from that of the cells themselves, if one starts to grow too big or if something else comes along and effects their function, then the brake can't take it anymore and thecancer cell will progress.	tumor suppressor genes	Explain how tumor suppressor genes is like car brakes.

The simple analogy of a firefly in the dark room is that a wave mechanical model appears like a relatively small, faint light in comparison to the darkness around it. The waves emanating from the model are smaller and weaker than those coming from reality, with less space between them. This creates an illusion of transparency, which makes it easy for observers to see what is happening at any given time.	wave mechanical model	Explain how wave mechanical model is like firefly in a dark room.
A wave mechanical model is like a firefly in a dark room. When the light of an electronic device such as a film projector shines on it, the waves created by the projection are reflected back and forth between the screen and the object on which they were displayed. This creates patterns that can be noticed because they are so small compared to other things in the room.	wave mechanical model	Explain how wave mechanical model is like firefly in a dark room.
A wave mechanical model is similar to a firefly in a dark room. When you shine light on an object, the light hits it and reflects off of the surface like a radar beam.

Protein translation is much like language translation. Both proteins and mRNA (molecules encoding the protein) are translated into text, which can be used by the cells to make decisions about how to act based on what they've been told.	protein translation	Explain how protein translation is like language translation.
Protein translation is similar to languagetranslation because the amino acid sequence in a protein are translated into an mRNA, which is translated into a text. The difference between protein translation and language translation is that while protein Translation uses three steps (I) production of the peptide chain α- chains; catabolism of alpha-chain productions intermediates by bacterial enzymes IIII), III, IV; assembly of imported RNA transcript region IaRi) from random pieces of DNA The first step in protein translation is producing the peptide chain α-chains. This process begins with the gene for this specific Protein being expressed and then the Peptide Chain genes are turned on. Next, bacteria produces beta-cells which break down an enzyme called amidotransferase. Together these two groups will produce many different peptides over time until one arrives at the correct target site! Afteromerization occurs where YCH2 changes from Cys to Thr, leaving Gln behind. Once all these modifications have been made, it’s exported back intothe cell Cycle as translations start happening!	protein translation	Explain how protein translation is like language translation.
A protein is translated into a text of amino acids that are then actioned to create proteins in the cell. Translation begins with an mRNA (mRNA) which is created from DNA and translated into a clear string of sugar-phosphates called polypeptides. Once these polypeptides are assembled, they're sent out onto the cell membrane where they start wheeling around like bicycles until they find their target proteins who can actually do something with them.	protein translation	Explain how protein translation is like language translation.

An ecosystem is a web of life that includes all the organisms and their physical environment. In order to have an idea what we mean, let’s take a closer look at two specific examples: oceanography and city planning.The oceanography example can be illustrated with the following analogy: Imagine you are standing on top of an iceberg. Every day, more snow falls onto the iceberg; however, because there's so much space below it (the water), one day only a thin layer may fall off-balance and break through into the open sea. This process happens over time as pieces of an iceberg slowly drift away from shorelines- eventually leaving behind an area rich in saltwater called “Iceberg Lagoon” where fresh water seeps in AZURELY FROM THE WATER! The maintainance of these areas depends on many factors ranging from wind conditions to human activity such as harvesting resources like plankton or fish). City planning is also made up ofopportunities created by humans for economic growth and housing production within a constrained geographical area. However, unlike oceanography where new land is constantly being added to support Increased Population densities due to climate change, urban development patterns follow gradually established rules which variations depending upon location/density etc., leading to extensive gentrification processes taking place especially during boom years when places like Soho become instantly desirable properties again thanks To quick regeneration data (good availability Of resource intensive industry) We now live in Golden age eraaccording City Planning has finally come under attack from New Urbanism who see its flaws but remain locked out largely because they lack popular demos & Lobbyists	ecosystem	Explain how ecosystem is like cities.
An ecosystem is a community of plants and animals that live together in close proximity. In forests, for example, the trees and other plant life are tightly intertwined with the animallife that inhabits them. The air quality in a city is similar to what you would find outdoors: It's often full of particles from automobiles and other sources. However, because an ecosystem depends on natural resources (such as water or land) to exist, cities can also be fragile ecosystems. For example, when there's a drought in one part of town,...	ecosystem	Explain how ecosystem is like cities.
An ecosystem is a group of living plants and animals in an area that are interconnected. The environment contains everything from the soil to the air to the water.	ecosystem	Explain how ecosystem is like cities.
Ecosystem is like a city, but the environment and climate are much more complex. Cities are built on the premise that human beings can use them to create economic opportunities for themselves. With an ecosystem, however, there is no single people or company that benefits from all of its parts working in synergy. Rather, it depends on the interaction of many different types of organisms (e.g., trees and birds) as well as physical and chemical elements (e.g., water).	ecosystem	Explain how ecosystem is like cities.
An ecosystem is a collection of organisms and their environment. The term can be used to describe cities, as well, because the components in an ecosystem are related to one another. For example, trees provide oxygen for plants and animals nearby and help maintain the rhythm of weather patterns. When it comes to cities, pavement creates spaces for human activity that also support other forms of life including bird populations, cars and water use.	ecosystem	Explain how ecosystem is like cities.
A neuron can fire one action potential and then another. The first action potential is associated with the cell's release of neurotransmitters, which are responsible for sending signals between neurons. These neurotransmitters might cause a feeling of happiness, fear, or excitement. If these feelings continue to be felt regularly (or if they become stronger), then the neuron might start firing more frequently than it used to and that could lead to an increase in activity in other cells nearby.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain how propagation of an action potential down a neuron is like falling dominoes.
When an action potential propagates down a neuron, the membrane potential of that neuron changes. The number of charge carriers (those with positive charges) increases, while the number of negative Charge Carriers (those with negative charges) decreases. This change in membrane potential causes these particles to move along their axons and create a current.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain how propagation of an action potential down a neuron is like falling dominoes.
The propagation of an action potential down a neuron is like falling dominoes. Every time a neuron fires, it sends out an impulse. This impulse can be thought of as a short burst of energy that moves quickly through the cell. The implications of this are pretty amazing! For example, if you drop a domino down one street and then drop another domino down the next street, you will eventually fall all the way to the bottom of your street - and that's how it works with neurons too!	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain how propagation of an action potential down a neuron is like falling dominoes.
If you imagine a dominoes stacking up one after the other, each one hitting the next one below it, then your brain is thinking in terms of an action potential. When any neuron sends an action potential down its axon (the longest and most important part of a neuron), it triggers another neuron to send an actin response back up the same length of axon. This keeps going until every neuron along the axon has sent messages, creating a Harvey-Weinstein effect that creates voltage gradients across all their connections.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain how propagation of an action potential down a neuron is like falling dominoes.
A neuron's action potential is like a falling dominoes. When one of the dominoes falls, it messengers travel through the neuron to other neurons in order to create another action potential. This process continues until all of the dominoes have fallen, causing a giant electrical shock that causes cells to fire.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain how propagation of an action potential down a neuron is like falling dominoes.
When a frog breathes, the air is forced into their lungs from all directions. The pressure in the lungs triggers an automatic set of muscles to contract which then expels the air out of the lungs quickly and forcefully.	breathing mechanism of frogs	Explain how breathing mechanism of frogs is like blowing of the balloon.
When a frog Expires his air bubble, he inhales deeply and then exhales with simultaneous "a-ah" sounds. This is because when the pressure of the air inside the Air Bubble decrease Turkish term for it (öğretmen etti), in other words as frogs breathe less and less oxygenated atmospheric gas escapes from their lungs to mix with surrounding fresh air.	breathing mechanism of frogs	Explain how breathing mechanism of frogs is like blowing of the balloon.
The breathing mechanism of frogs is not like blowing of the balloon. When a frog inhales, air is pumped into their lungs and then they exhale all the air that was in their lungs when they took breathe before.	breathing mechanism of frogs	Explain how breathing mechanism of frogs is like blowing of the balloon.
The frog's breathing mechanism is very different from the human's. The human lungs produce air as they contract, which means that when you exhale, the air pressure in your lungs decreases andatha flow of breath into your lung spaces will stop. This difference in breathingMechanism between frogs and humans can be explained by one key fact: Frogs use their trachea to breatheTIPS FOR BREATHING LIKE A FROG 1) Place your mouth on the back of a young frog's throat (near where his spinal cord meets his neck). 2) Hold onto either end of thefrog's Trachoma (back part of mouth), while your other hand wraps around his nose/throat	breathing mechanism of frogs	Explain how breathing mechanism of frogs is like blowing of the balloon.
Frogs breathe through their mouth and inhalation. When the frog inhales, they constrict their air-upholstery vessels leading from the lungs to the intestines and then into their stomach. The since these pulmonary vascular conduits lead back up again to the brain we can think of them as a “balloon” type breathing mechanism because they move gas in and out of your body like a balloon does when you blow it with your breath	breathing mechanism of frogs	Explain how breathing mechanism of frogs is like blowing of the balloon.
Layer 1 is the communication layer, which consists of protocols and procedures that define how messages are transmitted. Layer 2 interprets these Protocols and Procedures to translate them into an appropriate language for the receiving system. Layer 3 carries these translations back and forwards between systems, providing a seamless message transfer experience.	layered architecture	Explain how layered architecture is like communication with translators.
Layer 1: The Translator Layer. This layer is responsible for translating English text into the desired language. It can also include features such as grammar checking and spellchecking. Layer 2: The Processor Layer. This layer takes in the translated text and processes it to get a message that is appropriate for the user's dialect of the language being used. For example, if you are using Spanish to communicate with someone from Mexico, your processor would likely convert Spanish words into Mexican terms so that they could be understood by the other person. Layer 3: The receptor Layer. This layer listens for messages sent down through layers 2 and 1 and then forwards them accordingly to their intended recipients.	layered architecture	Explain how layered architecture is like communication with translators.
In layered architecture, you have a communications layer (typically an application or server), which is used to send and receive messages. Then there is a data structure layer, used for holding the data sent by the communications layer. Finally, there is a user interface layer, which may be used to display or input data from the data structure layers.	layered architecture	Explain how layered architecture is like communication with translators.
Layer-by-layer communication is like translating a sentence from one language to another. Each layer in the hierarchy contains information that needs to be processed before the next can be sent. This allows for multiple processors to work on different parts of a message at the same time, which helps increase speed and accuracy.	layered architecture	Explain how layered architecture is like communication with translators.
In layered architecture, there are different layers that communicate with each other. In the first layer, you have the source code or text of the application. In the second layer, you have the translator which translates these source code or text into another language. The third and fourth layers are for data storage and processing, respectively.	layered architecture	Explain how layered architecture is like communication with translators.
If you have a candy can with only two types of sweeteners, Twilight and Donut, the distribution will be about 60% Twilight and 40% Donut. If you add in more sweeteners - like 3 or 4 - the proportion will change drastically; it could be as high as 98% Twilight and 2% Donut.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain how limiting reactant and excess reactant is like chocolate distribution.
When there is too much reactant, it creates a hot and angry environment in the chocolate. When there is not enough reactant, the temperature moderates and chocolate becomes more smooth.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain how limiting reactant and excess reactant is like chocolate distribution.
Limiting reactant and excess reactant is like chocolate distribution. In cocoa, the maximum amount of flavor that can be expressed is found in the first layer, which is made up mostly of neutral fats. The next layers are higher infatty acids (B vitamins, polyunsaturated fatty acids), and then there’s a lower number of monounsaturated fatty acids. Then comes the dry matter, consisting largely of237COCOA FatTY Acids %Dominates total Friction g/cc Raw Material content 100% Mashing process 68-72 hours Leaving Stage Practioner 3 hp All raw materials used were ground to a very fine consistency before mashed pasteurization at 121 degrees F for 48 hours).	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain how limiting reactant and excess reactant is like chocolate distribution.
When you isolate reactants, they are left in their original form. In chocolate production, this means that the cocoa bean contains both a large amount of reactant (the butter) and a small amount of excess reactant (asteroids). The mixture is then roasted or tempered until all of the reactant has been eliminated and the chocolate is smooth.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain how limiting reactant and excess reactant is like chocolate distribution.
When two substances are in close proximity, they start to react with each other. This is called "reactant accumulation." Reactants form an equilibrium between themselves and the environment. When one substance exceeds its limit of reactivity, it will require more reactant than the environment can offer before reacting. The excess reactant then goes into solution where it can be smelled or tasted.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain how limiting reactant and excess reactant is like chocolate distribution.

A prokaryotic cell is a small, single-celled organism that evolved from the original cells of an eukaryotic body. Prokaryotes are distinguished from eukaryotes by their lack of a nucleus and their ability to divide and grow larger than most unicellular organisms.	prokaryotic cell	Explain how prokaryotic cell is like self started business.
A prokaryotic cell is a type of cells in the kingdom Animalia. Prokaryotic cells are special because they can division into two types, which are called daughtercells and prophase. Daughtercells divide to create new daughtercells and prophase divides to produce another kind of cell-the pseudoprophase.	prokaryotic cell	Explain how prokaryotic cell is like self started business.
A prokaryotic cell is like a business in that it starts with a beginning and works its way up. Prokaryotic cells are made of DNA, which is the basic molecule for all life.

Prokaryotic cells have membranes that are made up of lipids (fatty molecules) and DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). They also lack chromosomes, which are structures in eukaryotic cells that assist with carrying out genetic instructions. The process by which prokaryotic cells start their own lives is called replication. Replication happens when one or more prokaryotic cells take what is called a template from another prokaryotic cell and use it to create new ones. During replication, these new prosocytes produce proteins that help them survive until they can reproduce themselves again	prokaryotic cell	Explain how prokaryotic cell is like self started business.

If a lump does form it will be jagged and difficult to remove without creating further problems for yourself (and friends).	limiting reactant	Explain how limiting reactant is like a cup of coffee granules.
The reactant cup is like a granule in that it contains a large amount of reactants. Reactants are materials that will cause the reaction mentioned earlier to occur. In the case of coffee, when you add water and beans to the pot, some of the water molecules become insoluble in bean material so it has to dissolve first before being able to combine with other substances. The same principle applies here: When adding salt (or any other limiting substance) to coffee, some liquid molecules must dissociate from old salts and create new ones as theybind with new fluid molecules on impact - this process is called solubility.	limiting reactant	Explain how limiting reactant is like a cup of coffee granules.

Interaction between drugs and receptor sites is like lock and key. When two substances are introduced into aSettings system (like the one that controls the activities of nerve cells), they must first find compatible receptors. If they do not match, something can go wrong with the chemistry in these systems, or even with the cell itself experienced as a result. The same goes for neurotransmitters: They need to find compatible binding sites on other molecules before communicating their instructions to nearby cells.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain how interaction between drugs and receptor sites is like lock and key.
When a drug binds to its receptor sites, it changes how that receptor responds. This can change the activity of the immune system, cause anxiety or depression, and even lead to addiction.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain how interaction between drugs and receptor sites is like lock and key.
The interaction between drugs and receptor sites is like a lock and key. When two drugs areadministered together, they tend to bind to the same receptor site on thecellular surface. However, because different drug concentrationsare required for binding to these receptors at different sites, certaindrugs may still be able to enter the cell but not others. In other words, someDrugs might activate certain receptor sites whileothers do not. Because of this property, it is importantto determine which specific receptor site has been activated by a particular Drug before trying touse that Drug again.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain how interaction between drugs and receptor sites is like lock and key.
Drugs and receptor sites interact like a lock and key. When two drugs bind to the same receptor site, they form a drug-receptor complex. This complex is similar in structure to an alloy of two metals: when one metal meets anothermetal at a particular spot (a interface), it creates sparks that cause the second metal to heat up, turn into molten form and eventually fall out of the interaction permanently. The result of this process is that the two drugs can't mix together properly, which leads to side effects or even overdose.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain how interaction between drugs and receptor sites is like lock and key.
The way drugs and receptors interact is like a lock and key. When you put something in the lock, it becomes impossible for anyone else to get into the room. The same is true when you put someone's receptor site in front of them and want them to take a drug, they will only be able to take that drug if their receptor site is on thedrug themselves.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain how interaction between drugs and receptor sites is like lock and key.
The interaction between drugs and receptor sites is like foot fitting in footprint. Drug molecules interact with receptors to cause a change in the chemical environment inside the receptor. This changes how the receptor responds to other chemicals or proteins present on the exterior of the receptor.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain how interaction between drugs and receptor sites is like foot fitting in footprint.
When a person walks on earth, their weight202 caused the Earth's surface to move. This action is termed gravity and it pulls objects up or down because of how much mass has been added to the planet over time. The amount of force applied by gravity plays an important role in determining how far someone can walk before they fall. In Pharmacology, drugs work very similarly to gravity - they are added to a substance and when these substances come into contact with another receptor site on the body (i.e.,Your skin), specific chemical reactions occur that cause physical changes in the body and also allow drug molecules to bind with other receptors more effectively. When two different receptors interact with each other, this interaction results in an amplifier/detector cell being activated which will increase or decrease medication binding affinity at that particular site-this process happens millions of times per day!	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain how interaction between drugs and receptor sites is like foot fitting in footprint.
The interaction between drugs and receptor sites is like foot fitting in footprint. When you put your feet into the footprints of other people, their shoes will fit nicely because they have a same shape and size inside of them. However, when you try to stand up from a sitting position, your toes will not fit inside of someone else's shoe properly. This is why it is important to get accurate information about the sizes and shapes of drug receptors before starting any treatment regimen.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain how interaction between drugs and receptor sites is like foot fitting in footprint.
Interaction between drugs and receptor sites is like foot fitting in footprint. The drug Action potential (AP) travels along the presynaptic membrane from synaptic site to synapse, where it energy charges the neurotransmitterGabapentin or its ligand Disulfiram. Gabapentin binding to its first site results in currents flowing through the channel complexing with other channels localized at adjacent passthroughs creating an "umbrella" conductance of about 1000 mS/m. Binding of Disulfiram results in a decrease of current flow through thechannel complex and a return of cable resistance values near resting levels  This eventuates in increased permeability τ c = 10-5 S-1 for Gabapentin andτ c = 500 nS-1 for Disulfiram at exposed pore trafficking domains	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain how interaction between drugs and receptor sites is like foot fitting in footprint.

The age of a tree is determined by how much wood it has left to grow. The calculation for trees is like the calculation for coral: -The older the tree, the less wood it has left to grow. -Trees are measured in years, and each year they add new growth so their total length grows over time.-In order to determine an object's age, you would subtract its original length from its current length (in years).	tree's age calculation	Explain how tree's age calculation is like coral's age calculation.
In both cases, the tree/coral's age is measured in years. The coral's age is determined by measuring how much growth and newly formed tissue has taken place since it was last photographed.	tree's age calculation	Explain how tree's age calculation is like coral's age calculation.
The age calculation for a tree is similar to the age calculation for coral. The first step of the tree's age calculation is to find how many years have passed since it was fertilized by an available pollen. This can be done using a variety of methods, but most often just uses simple arithmetic。  Next, the tree must determine how tall it has grown in that time frame. This can be done either based on real-world metrics or by measuring changes over time in specific aspects of its growth like height or branch length. Once these factors are taken into account, the tree's current size and shape can be calculated.—>	tree's age calculation	Explain how tree's age calculation is like coral's age calculation.
Tree's age is calculation like coral's age. Tree grows and dies, so the growth rate of a tree is also related to its life expectancy. To figure out how old a tree is, you subtract its current life-expectancy from the total lifespan of all trees in your area (based on data from different sources).	tree's age calculation	Explain how tree's age calculation is like coral's age calculation.
The age calculation for a tree is like coral's age calculation. The key difference between trees and coral is that trees grow older over time, while corals Die out. In order to calculate an adult's age, the number of years it has been alive must be calculated as its height minus its diameter at the leaf base. Trees typically have around 100 years on them whereas corals can live up to 400+ years sometimes!	tree's age calculation	Explain how tree's age calculation is like coral's age calculation.
A glycolysis is like a roller coaster ride. It goes up and down, with some peaks and valleys in between. This process occurs when glucose is converted into pyruvate, which can then be used by the body to create energy.	glycolysis	Explain how glycolysis is like roller coaster.
Glycolysis is a process that happens when one molecule of glucose (the sugar in bread) gets chopped up into long, short chains. These chains can then help to make other molecules.	glycolysis	Explain how glycolysis is like roller coaster.

There is a lot of energy stored in the ball when it comes into contact with the plate. This energy is released as light and sound waves. The pressure that was applied to the ball before impact will also cause stress on the metal plates boundary which can scatter these waves.	anti-stokes scattering	Explain how anti-stokes scattering is like ball striking a plate.
When a ball is thrown from one hand to the other, it will cause some scattered light to be thrown back. This light will come in many directions, and some of it may hit the object that was throwed. In order for this ball to make contact with the plate, there must be enough unprotected side area on the plate for both objects to Impact perfectly - otherwise called anti-stokes scattering.	anti-stokes scattering	Explain how anti-stokes scattering is like ball striking a plate.
When an object is thrown at high speed, it creates a disturbance in the air. This disturbance can be described by waves called Rayleigh scattering and anti-stokes scattering. In Rayleigh scattering, smaller particles scatter more of the original energy from the larger particle(s). This results in weaker waves because there are less obstacles between the smaller and large objects. Anti-Stokes scattering occurs when one or more atoms within an object scatter short momentary wave paths away from each other instead of Following their long path (like balls hitting a plate). By doing this, there is more space for momentum to dissipate and stronger waveforms form due to both distance traveled as well as time delay.	anti-stokes scattering	Explain how anti-stokes scattering is like ball striking a plate.
The anti-stokes scattering is when two objects are closely approaching each other and start to scatter light in all directions. This happens because the particles in one object scatter more light than the particles inside of the other object.	anti-stokes scattering	Explain how anti-stokes scattering is like ball striking a plate.
The image at the top of this page is a 3D representation of an anti-stokes scattering experiment. The camera captures a beam of light, and then casts one or more shadows on the wall behind it. These shadows are created by how the light scatter as it travels through the air.	anti-stokes scattering	Explain how anti-stokes scattering is like ball striking a plate.
Stokes scattering is like ball striking a plate. The sound waves are scattered in all directions, depending on the distance between the object and the listener.	stokes scattering	Explain how stokes scattering is like ball striking a plate.
Stokes scattering is like ball striking a plate. The behavior of the object depends on how much light errors are introduced into the data by the introducing stokes.	stokes scattering	Explain how stokes scattering is like ball striking a plate.
When an object hits a plate, the energy of the impact makes it scatter in all directions. This is why you can't see things coming if you're hit in the head by a fastball: your brain interprets the contact as a ball and doesn't process any other potential impacts that might have happened during your collision. The same principle exists when an object strikes another person: every angle counts, so there's no reliable way to tell how many different objects were involved in the strike.	stokes scattering	Explain how stokes scattering is like ball striking a plate.
When a ball is hit with a sudden force, it rebounds off the ground and smacks into another object. This action can also be called pushing or thrusting. The force of impact creates an air resistance that causes the ball to travel in acircle at high speed before hitting again. This TravelingCircleEffectStokesScattering phenomenon occurs when light scatters several times as it passes through obstacles - most commonly plate glass windows.	stokes scattering	Explain how stokes scattering is like ball striking a plate.
Stokes scattering is very similar to ball striking a plate. The difference is that when a ball strikes a plate, the energy involved in the collision causes indentations or dents on the surface of the plate. These indentations are caused by air fleeing from the area of impact and moving towards another part of the plate where it will be more stable. This allows for an accurate picture of how much energy was used in each contact between object and substrate - this information is called " infill." "Ballstrike theory"; stokes scattering	stokes scattering	Explain how stokes scattering is like ball striking a plate.

It is used to calculate how many people will die from an overdose of a specific poison, as well as how much antidote someone can receive in response to an overdose.	median lethal dose	Explain how median lethal dose is like balls and target.
A median lethal dose is a quantity that tells us the average amount of harm done to someone by a particular poison. It's like saying we found an average weight for all objects in a room - this gives us some guidance on how much damage something might do.	median lethal dose	Explain how median lethal dose is like balls and target.
Median lethal dose is a measure of the amount of poison that can kill an animal in one millionth of a second. The target is the amount that would kill the animal if it were to fall on top of the Median Lethal Dose ball.	median lethal dose	Explain how median lethal dose is like balls and target.
Median lethal dose is similar to a ball. Two balls are comparison because they both have a mass and an assigned point in space (the center of the ball). A target, on the other hand, has noMass and therefore cannot be compared directly. The median lethal dose for albino rats is around 100 mg/kg bodyweight. This means that if one rat falls within this range, then it would likely die from abuse or malnutrition before experiencing any injuries or fatalities from potentially deadly doses of radiation.	median lethal dose	Explain how median lethal dose is like balls and target.

Water level in a dam is controlled by the weight of the people, animals and vehicles above it. The waterlevel also changes with the weather because of evaporation and precipitation. In lakes, water level is controlled byental factors such as wind speed and direction, tidal waves and wave height.	chemical equilibrium	Explain how chemical equilibrium is like water level in dam and lake.
Chemical equilibrium (the state in which a chemical mixture is close to being evenly mixed) results when the concentration of any one member of the mixture is at or near its natural level. In a dam, water levels are constantly changing as shrimps and other aquatic creatures swim upstream and downstream; this movement creates an imbalance that can be seen in the form of high and low water points. The higher point gets pushed down by the current, while the lower point rises because of Pressure from above. This process continues until both points are equal again. In lakes, whenever fish feed on plants or animals living in suspension (such as plankton), theyuck up some material that has been dissolved intouelve particles called nutrients available for growth by bacteria present in the water's surface layer. These small suspended materials tend to raise lake levels due to their own weight and currents below than on top where sediments live and sink.	chemical equilibrium	Explain how chemical equilibrium is like water level in dam and lake.
Chemical equilibrium is the state of a substance in which its relative weights are such that no chemical reaction takes place. In dams and lakes, the water level changes as you add more and more salt to it, because the concentration of each element rises and falls with the addition of vo	chemical equilibrium	Explain how chemical equilibrium is like water level in dam and lake.
Water level in dam and lake are controlled by the amount of water that is available to cover the bottom of the reservoir. The deeper a dam is, the more water it can store before its capacity becomes too low. This means that when there is enough water stored in a dam, it will overflow during heavy rains because liquid air can’t replace what was lost from space. In contrast, chemical equilibrium is maintained between two fluids by exchanging one fluid for another at fixed points ( Pillow Points ), where ends of filters or other devices prevent total exchange of both fluids until conditions preset become again satisfactory	chemical equilibrium	Explain how chemical equilibrium is like water level in dam and lake.
Water level in dam and lake are always the same because they are made up of air, water, and rocks. Chemical equilibrium is like this too- all the different chemicals in a solution mix together to create what we call an equilibrium state. When these solutions reach this equilibrium point, no more or less will enter or leave the solution and everything will be at its original position.	chemical equilibrium	Explain how chemical equilibrium is like water level in dam and lake.

Electric Circuit is very similar to air flowing through a tube. When an electric current flows through an electric cable, the electrons in the wire are pushed and pulled around by the electricity. These movement of electrons can create sparks that make things spark when they touch or move over each other. like with air, if you want to connect two pieces of electrical equipment together, then you need to keep each piece connected by a special type of wire called a conductor	electric circuit	Explain how electric circuit is like air flowing through a tube.
Electric circuits are like a tube of air that is flowing through it. The electric current (flow) through the circuit is changing the temperature of the air in different places.	electric circuit	Explain how electric circuit is like air flowing through a tube.
Electric circuits are like pipelines where electric current (the flow of heat) is used to move fluid substances. In an electric pipeline, the fluid substances are moving along the path of least resistance and they also interact with each other to create a voltage. This voltage can be turned on or off by means of electrically controlled switches.	electric circuit	Explain how electric circuit is like air flowing through a tube.
An electric circuit is like an air flow through a tube. When you plug in electricity to a appliance, the circuit becomes open and current flows between the component parts of the electrical system. Electric fields within the circuits keep things connected and powered on while outside forces push or pull electrons around in the material paths.	electric circuit	Explain how electric circuit is like air flowing through a tube.
An electric current flows through the wire between two metals or plates. When this current is high, the metal(s) starts to heat up and vaporize (turn into gas). This vaporized material can be averaged over a large region by the aneroid Jakemeters and it is then used as a reference for finding out how much electricity is flowing in each direction along that path.	electric circuit	Explain how electric circuit is like rope through metal rings.
Electric circuit is like a rope through metal rings. The electric field strengths in each ring are related to one another and to the current (i) flowing through the wire.	electric circuit	Explain how electric circuit is like rope through metal rings.
Electric circuits are like ropes through metal rings. When you touch one end of the rope to a metal ring, electricity flows from the higher power source (the battery) down the rope and into the lower power source (the device being wired together). This is how electric circuits work: The higher power sources generate more electricity than they need, which is used to create currents in the devices connected to them. These currents flow through wires - often made out of plastic or other cheaper materials - and make things move.	electric circuit	Explain how electric circuit is like rope through metal rings.
Electric circuits are very similar to ropes through metal rings. The electric field between the two materials creates a force that causes the cable to move in one direction or another. This same principle applies to electric circuits, which are just made up of electrical wires.	electric circuit	Explain how electric circuit is like rope through metal rings.
Electric Circuit is like a rope through metal rings. When two electric charges are attracted to each other, the electricity will flow between them in a V shape.	electric circuit	Explain how electric circuit is like rope through metal rings.
The hydrophobic effect is like teenagers at a party. They are all drinking alcohol, talking loudly and generally having a good time. The water that surrounds them has the opposite effect- it keeps them isolated and gives off an unpleasant smell.	hydrophobic effect	Explain how hydrophobic effect is like teenagers at a party.
A hydrophobic effect is like when you go to a party and everyone has their own drink. You can't help but end up getting drinks on your clothes, in your hair, and all over the place.	hydrophobic effect	Explain how hydrophobic effect is like teenagers at a party.
When someone is hydrophobic, they tend to avoid water because it seems like everything will stick to them. Teenagers usually have this same mindset when it comes to people and things.	hydrophobic effect	Explain how hydrophobic effect is like teenagers at a party.
If you were to ask a teenage how they feel about going out with friends, one would most likely say that it is exciting and fun. However, if the same teenager asked you now how they are feeling about their party so far, withoutHydrophobic effect present in their conversation, the answer would be different. Teenagers today experience an increased sense of anxiety around water based objects as due to hydrophobic effect freshmen often find themselves labeled as 'crappy' or even 'bad'.	hydrophobic effect	Explain how hydrophobic effect is like teenagers at a party.
When two objects are close together, they will tend to form a line since the water molecules on each object attract each other. The closer an object is to another object, the more hydrophobic it will be (meaning that it is less wet). This can be seen in the example of teenagers at a party - when one person gets hold of something, they typically force their friends and others around them to try and get a grip too.	hydrophobic effect	Explain how hydrophobic effect is like teenagers at a party.
Biological signal transduction is the process by which cells communicate with each other through molecules called messengers. messenger molecules are produced when a cell divides and start to grow new proteins. These proteins carry messages from one cell to another, and can also transport hormones or environmental signals. Biological signal transduction is often quick and direct-an animal will usually respond within seconds if it feels threatened	biological signal transduction	Explain how biological signal transduction is like threat communication in animals.
Biological signal transduction is a process by which messages are sent from one organ or cell to another. Signals can be physical signals such as sound, heat, light and chemical substances, or they could be non-physical signals like emotional preferences. Biological signal transduction happens in the body's cells and involves chemicals that interact with receptor proteins to send messages across the membrane.	biological signal transduction	Explain how biological signal transduction is like threat communication in animals.
Biological signal transduction is like threat communication in animals. When one animal sends a chemical message to another, the same process happens that happens when an animal uses facial muscles to communicate. The difference is that biological signals are not as loud and they don't travel as quickly through the air.	biological signal transduction	Explain how biological signal transduction is like threat communication in animals.
Biological signal transduction is the process by which hormones and other biochemical signals are sent from one cell or organ to another in order to initiate a response. In animals, this process usually results in the release of chemicals that can interact with neighboring cells or organs in order to cause an effect.	biological signal transduction	Explain how biological signal transduction is like threat communication in animals.
Biological signal transduction is like threat communication in animals. A biological system sends a signal to another system when it feels an emergency. signals can be electrical, chemical, or behavioral.	biological signal transduction	Explain how biological signal transduction is like threat communication in animals.
