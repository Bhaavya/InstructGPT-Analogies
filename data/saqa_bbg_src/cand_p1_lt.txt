A video card is analogous to an eye. A video card is a device that allows a computer to display images. The images on a video card are created by the computer and are sent to the video card for display.	video card	Explain how video card is analogous to eye.
The age calculation for trees and coral is similar. The difference is that coral is a living organism that can produce new coral cells every day, while trees only produce wood. The age calculation is also similar in that trees and coral grow and die over time.	tree's age calculation	Explain how tree's age calculation is analogous to coral's age calculation.
Glycolysis is a process in which glucose is broken down into two molecules of glucose and one molecule of pyruvate. This process is similar to the process that happens on a roller coaster. The ride goes up and down, and the person on the ride can feel the energy that is being created by the roller coaster. This is the same thing that is happening in the body when the person is breaking down glucose into two molecules of glucose and one molecule of pyruvate.	glycolysis	Explain how glycolysis is analogous to roller coaster.
When a ball is struck by a plate, the ball is scattered in all directions. This is because the plate is made of many small pieces that are scattered in every direction. The same is true for a person when they are hit by an anti-stokes scattering object. The object is made of many small pieces that are scattered in every direction.	anti-stokes scattering	Explain how anti-stokes scattering is analogous to ball striking a plate.
Stokes scattering is analogous to ball striking a plate. The difference is that a ball striking a plate is a direct hit, while stokes scattering is a reflection off of a surface. This means that the energy of the ball is scattered in many directions, some of which are more energy than others. This is why a ball hitting a plate can be seen as a series of dots on the screen, as each hit creates a new pattern of energy that is scattered in many directions.	stokes scattering	Explain how stokes scattering is analogous to ball striking a plate.
Median lethal dose is a measure of the amount of a poison that will kill 50% of the people who take it. It is also a measure of the amount of poison that will kill a specific person.	median lethal dose	Explain how median lethal dose is analogous to balls and target.
The universe is analogous to the surface of a balloon. The surface of a balloon is flat, but the inside of the balloon is round. The universe is also flat, but the inside of the universe is round.	universe	Explain how universe is analogous to surface of a balloon.
Enzyme mechanism analogy is that a lock and key analogy. Enzyme mechanism analogy is that a molecule that catalyzes a chemical reaction is like a key that unlocks a door. The key is inserted into the lock and the door is opened.	enzyme mechanism	Explain how enzyme mechanism is analogous to lock and key.
Anova is a statistical technique used to find signals in the noise. It is similar to finding a signal in the noise, except that anova is used to find the difference between two sets of data.	anova	Explain how anova is analogous to finding signal in the noise.
The hypothalamus is a small, Located in the brainstem, it is responsible for controlling body temperature. The thermostat is a device that uses a temperature sensor to control the temperature of a room or home.	thermostat	Explain how thermostat is analogous to hypothalamus.
Chemical equilibrium is analogous to water level in a dam and a lake. In a dam, the water level is controlled by the weight of the objects in the dam. In a lake, the water level is controlled by the weight of the objects in the lake.	chemical equilibrium	Explain how chemical equilibrium is analogous to water level in dam and lake.
Just-in-time is a term used in the food industry to describe the process of manufacturing food products in a timely manner so that they are available when needed. Just-in-time is also used in the construction industry to describe the process of building products in a timely manner so that they are available when needed.	just-in-time	Explain how just-in-time is analogous to water and rocks.
Adaptive immunity is analogous to police headquerters. Police headquerters are individuals who are specially trained in identifying and apprehending criminals. Adaptive immunity is the same concept, except that it is used to describe individuals who are specifically trained in recognizing and responding to the effects of environmental stressors.	adaptive immunity	Explain how adaptive immunity is analogous to police headquerters.
Ohm's law is analogous to cats, mice and cake because it states that the current in a resistor is inversely proportional to the resistance of the resistor.	ohm's law	Explain how ohm's law is analogous to cats, mice and cake.
Transcription is a process of copying text from one medium to another. In transcription, the text is copied one letter at a time, usually using a pencil. Then, the text is scanned into a computer, where it is converted into a text format. This text is then read by a human being, who may make mistakes or change the text depending on the source material.	transcription	Explain how transcription is analogous to photocopying.
Rna polymerase is analogous to a Xerox machine. It can create copies of itself, and can also cut and paste pieces of DNA.	rna polymerase	Explain how rna polymerase is analogous to xerox machine.
Ribosome is analogous to a cook. A cook is responsible for the cooking of food. Ribosome is responsible for the translation of mRNA into proteins.	ribosome	Explain how ribosome is analogous to cook.
Activator protein is analogous to bookmarks because it is a protein that helps to keep track of where a particular gene has been expressed.	activator protein	Explain how activator protein is analogous to bookmarks.
Electric circuits are analogous to airflows through tubes. The electric current in a tube is analogous to the air current flowing through a tube. The electric fields in a tube are analogous to the fields in the air. The speed of the electric current in a tube is analogous to the speed of the air current. The size of the electric current in a tube is analogous to the size of the air current.	electric circuit	Explain how electric circuit is analogous to air flowing through a tube.
Electric circuits are analogous to ropes through metal rings because they are composed of metal wires that are connected together. The wires are connected to the battery, and the battery is connected to the electric current. The electric current is used to power the device that is being used, and the device is powered by the battery.	electric circuit	Explain how electric circuit is analogous to rope through metal rings.
When a person is hydrophobic, they are less likely to interact with other people. This is because hydrophobic molecules are attracted to water molecules. Teenagers at a party are likely to be more hydrophobic than adults because they are still developing their social skills.	hydrophobic effect	Explain how hydrophobic effect is analogous to teenagers at a party.
Biological signal transduction is analogous to threat communication in animals. Signals are sent from one molecule to another in order to communicate a message. The message can be a warning, a threat, or a request. Biological signal transduction can also be used to communicate with other animals.	biological signal transduction	Explain how biological signal transduction is analogous to threat communication in animals.
