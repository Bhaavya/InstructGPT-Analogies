Glycolysis is a process in which glucose is broken down into two molecules of glucose and one molecule of pyruvate. This process is used to produce energy in the body. Roller coaster rides use the same process to produce energy as the body does, which is why they are so popular.	glycolysis	Explain how glycolysis is similar to roller coaster.
When a person strikes a ball with their hand, the ball is scattered in all directions. This is also true when someone strikes an object with their hand, such as a plate. The ball is scattered in all directions because the object is a medium that scatter the ball in all directions.	anti-stokes scattering	Explain how anti-stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate.
Stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate. The difference is that a ball striking a plate is a direct hit, while stokes scattering is a reflection off of a surface. This reflection can be seen as a line in the image below, where the blue line is the direct hit, and the red and green lines are the reflections.	stokes scattering	Explain how stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate.
Median lethal dose is a measure of the average lethal dose of a poison. It is similar to the target dose, which is the average lethal dose of a poison that a human can die from.	median lethal dose	Explain how median lethal dose is similar to balls and target.
The universe is similar to the surface of a balloon. The surface of a balloon is made up of air and gas. The universe is made up of particles, including atoms and molecules, and the surface of a balloon is also made up of particles. The particles in the universe are distributed evenly and at a very low speed.	universe	Explain how universe is similar to surface of a balloon.
Enzyme mechanism is similar to lock and key. Enzyme mechanism uses a protein to catalyze a chemical reaction. The protein is attached to a metal atom and the metal atom is attached to a molecule. The protein catalyzes the chemical reaction by binding to the metal atom and releasing the molecule.	enzyme mechanism	Explain how enzyme mechanism is similar to lock and key.
Anova is a statistical technique used to find signals in the noise. It is similar to finding signal in the noise because it allows you to compare the results of different experiments with a greater degree of accuracy.	anova	Explain how anova is similar to finding signal in the noise.
The hypothalamus is a small, white, crescent-shaped structure located at the base of the brain. It is responsible for controlling body temperature and is also responsible for controlling the production of hormones such as cortisol.	thermostat	Explain how thermostat is similar to hypothalamus.
Water level in a dam is controlled by the height of the water above the dam. Chemical equilibrium is controlled by the concentration of chemicals in the water.	chemical equilibrium	Explain how chemical equilibrium is similar to water level in dam and lake.
Just-in-time is a term used to describe the process of manufacturing products or services in a timely manner so that they are available when needed. Just-in-time is also similar to water and rocks because they are all materials that can be used to create things.	just-in-time	Explain how just-in-time is similar to water and rocks.
Adaptive immunity is the ability of an organism to respond to environmental stressors in a way that is beneficial to the organism. Police headquerters are similar to adaptive immunity in that they are able to respond to stressors in a way that is beneficial to the officer.	adaptive immunity	Explain how adaptive immunity is similar to police headquerters.
Ohm's law is a law of electricity that states that the current in a wire is inversely proportional to the voltage across the wire.	ohm's law	Explain how ohm's law is similar to cats, mice and cake.
Transcription is a process of copying text from one medium to another. In transcription, the text is copied one letter at a time, usually using a transcription machine. Then, the text is scanned into the computer and the text is converted to text form.	transcription	Explain how transcription is similar to photocopying.
Rna polymerase is similar to a Xerox machine because it can photocopy DNA.	rna polymerase	Explain how rna polymerase is similar to xerox machine.
Ribosome is a protein-carrying organelle in the cell. It is responsible for the translation of mRNA into proteins. Cook uses ribosomes to cook food. Ribosomes are also used to make proteins in the body.	ribosome	Explain how ribosome is similar to cook.
Activator protein is similar to bookmarks because it is a protein that helps to keep track of where a person has been in the past.	activator protein	Explain how activator protein is similar to bookmarks.
Electric circuits are similar to airflows through tubes. Electric circuits are made up of small electrical components that work together to create a force that moves something. This force is called electricity.	electric circuit	Explain how electric circuit is similar to air flowing through a tube.
Electric circuits are similar to ropes through metal rings because they use electricity to create a path between two points. When you touch the metal ring with your hand, you create a current of electricity that travels through the metal ring and up your arm. The same is true when you connect two points in an electric circuit with an electric wire.	electric circuit	Explain how electric circuit is similar to rope through metal rings.
When you are at a party, you are likely to be surrounded by people. This means that you will be exposed to a lot of different smells and flavors. This can make you feel thirsty and hungry. Hydrophobic effect is the same as teenagers at a party. It is when you are surrounded by water, and the water makes you feel wet.	hydrophobic effect	Explain how hydrophobic effect is similar to teenagers at a party.
Biological signal transduction is similar to threat communication in animals because both systems use physical and chemical signals to communicate with other animals. Biological signals can be used to warn other animals of a potential danger, and chemical signals can be used to attract other animals to a location.	biological signal transduction	Explain how biological signal transduction is similar to threat communication in animals.
