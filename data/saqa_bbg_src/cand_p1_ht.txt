Chromatin is a type of protein that makes up the cell wall. Chromatin consists of small, delicate proteins and helps to pack the nucleus apart so DNA can be copied. The factory gate analogy would be imagine trying to fit all your clothes into one suitcase- you could theoretically do this with chromatin, too. However, because it’s moreComplicated than just packing clothes in a suitcase, it becomes very difficult to cram everything in and eventually something will get spilled out or along the way!	cell wall	Explain how cell wall is analogous to factory gate.

Cell wall is analogous to a security guard. A cell wall is an obstacle in the way of growth and invasion by bacteria or other cells, which can lead to infection. Acellular organisms are typically smaller than those that form granuloma or sarcoma, so they cannot grow through cell walls easily.

"Cells are analogous to restaurants because they provide food and shelter for organisms that live within the body," said study article author Dr. Josephine Demarest, an associate professor of biochemistry at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City." They do this by mitosing and growing new cells, creating blood vessels, making bones and teeth, producing milk products like chorionic gonadotropin (CG) and testosterone,* preparing foods such as meat or dairy products*, puttingrefying carbohydrates into breakable molecules called glycogen or starchose ninhydrin with enzymes† to release energy from these raw materials intoElectron volts" " RESTAURANT: A BUSINESS THAT PROVIDES FOOD AND SHELTER FOR ORGANISMES THAT LIVE INSIDE THE BODY"	cells	Explain how cells is analogous to restaurant.
Cellular reproduction is the process by which new cells are generated in a living organism.

These fluids coming out of your stomach are also called "transport fluid" because each time something goes into or leaves your body it takes up space ( TRANSPORT FUEL ). The ingredients on Your plate come back out again in different forms like juice, soup etc... these liquids are all made up of tiny pieces called minerals and waste materials but we call them CONTENTS .

Capacitance is similar to heat content in that it measures how much resistance an object has to receiving electricity.	capacitance	Explain how capacitance is analogous to heat content.
Capacitance is the difference between a capacitor and an inductor. Capacitors store energy, while inductors do not. When you connect two capacitors together, they form ainductorNet . The electrical current through the capacitor from one input to another will be less than if there was no capacitor connected. This is because when electrons flow freely through capacitors, they create heat which can easily dissipate in time (the "temperature" of these devices). Conversely, when an electronic transistor is turned on it creates an electric field that charges up its local capacitance (remember? capacitance = effectiveness ofElectric Field). Nowadays we use transistors with metal films as dielectric layers between them to increase their efficiency - but this type of technology still uses AC power!	capacitance	Explain how capacitance is analogous to heat content.

The key difference between football and cell biology is the amount of communication that takes place between players. In football, each player uses a limited number of muscles to move around the field. This limitations is why teams often rely on play-calling to guide their strategies. However, in cells, specialization occurs when different cells work together in order to create or support a particular function. For example, certain proteins are essential for growth and development while others are involved in basic functions such as energy production or destruction. As a result,cell biologists have developed ways to measure how well individual cells communicate with one another bylooking at mRNA levels (a molecule made up of letters that carry information) and protein expression (the level of activity).	specialization and communication in a cell	Explain how specialization and communication in a cell is analogous to football.
In football, there is a lot of specialization in how players play; they are usually position-based. In the cell, each person has limited communication with other cells because they arelimited to what theiroglobin can send out and receive back. This restricts the amount of information that can be communicated between people.	specialization and communication in a cell	Explain how specialization and communication in a cell is analogous to football.
In football, players specialize in certain roles and communicate with each other through sign language.

A football game is a competition between teams of players who are armed with sticks and balls. The team that scores the most goals by hitting their opponents' goals with these objects wins the match. In cells, specialization results in faster communication between cells due to the fact that these individuals have been specifically selected for this task. This process also allows for synchronization of Wall Street traders as they take action based on information received from other markets.	specialization and communication in a cell	Explain how specialization and communication in a cell is analogous to football.
In football, players are divided into three teams and each team is given a specific role to play. For example, the quarterback may be on offense and the receivers may be on defense. In a cell, members of different cells are assigned to carry out specific tasks within their respective populations.	specialization and communication in a cell	Explain how specialization and communication in a cell is analogous to football.
 Kirchoff's voltage law is a analogy to hiking. Hiking consists of walking and as you walk your feet get harder and more pesant because the ground is lower on each step. The same occurs with electricity, where Voltage (V) comes from the higher up it goes in an electrical circuit. When we hike our shoes get harder androunder than when we just stand still so there must be something causing this increase in force on our feet that helps us move forward. This thing can be called 'kinetic energy'. Similarly, when we connect pieces of metal together through a wire they will create electric current which increases with distance because the heavier object dragging alongthe wire takes more kinetic energy to overcome resistance (R). Kinetic energy created by contact between two materials has nothing to do with weight or size though; rather it is due to their different shapes and densities.	kirchoff's voltage law	Explain how kirchoff's voltage law is analogous to hiking.
Kirchoff's Voltage Law states that the voltage (V) of an AC electric current (I) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two points, or inversely proportional to the time delay between those points. This law can be used analogyically to describe hiking - as long as one remembers that V = I × D, where "d" is time.	kirchoff's voltage law	Explain how kirchoff's voltage law is analogous to hiking.
A hiking analogy would be to say that kirchoff's voltage law is analogous to the payroll taxes we pay each month. The amount of tax we owe depends on how much money we have in our bank account and what type of financial statement our employer has prepared (income, expenses, inventory) for us. Kirchoff's voltage law is just like this: if you hike your electricity bill by 10% every month, then your electric company will increase your electric bill by 100% when you suddenly go without power because they can smell gasoline being burned under the house.	kirchoff's voltage law	Explain how kirchoff's voltage law is analogous to hiking.
Kirchoff's voltage law is analogous to hiking. When a person hikes, they are using power from their feet to hike up a hill. Kirchoff was trying to find an analogy betweenhiking and electricity.

A density wave is like a traffic jam on a highway. If you are at the front of the line and someone moves to the back, it will cause your speed to drop and your chances of getting through will improve. The same is true with waves - if you're in the middle of one, its effects will be largest near the surface because there's more time for other people to get around you. However, as soon as you move away from the center, these effects begin to dissipate and your chance of getting throughars much lower.	nature of a density wave	Explain how nature of a density wave is analogous to traffic jam on a highway.
A density wave is created when a dense object such as a person or animal falls. As the object falls, it creates turbulence in the air. This turbulence causes by-products to form including particles of gas and liquid that are close to each other and at different densities. These By-products interact with one another and create a pressure wave which travels through the medium faster than the objects themselves.	nature of a density wave	Explain how nature of a density wave is analogous to traffic jam on a highway.
A density wave is analogous to the traffic jam on a highway. The waves are created when people are flowing through a specific area, and they eventually reach their destination. It's important to note that the height of these waves depends on how many people are in an area at any given time, so it can be difficult to predict where they will intersect.	nature of a density wave	Explain how nature of a density wave is analogous to traffic jam on a highway.
A density wave is like a traffic jam on a highway. The more people in the waves, the faster they move. The more time there is between the waves, the slower they are.	nature of a density wave	Explain how nature of a density wave is analogous to traffic jam on a highway.
Density waves are analogous to traffic jams on a highway. They are created when different objects and particles (like people) density increases in close vicinity, creating an obstacle or bottleneck. This can be seen in traffic situations where drivers need to get around intersections or other obstacles, but cannot do so perfectly because of the congestion. The same is true with atoms and molecules as they attempt to move through a liquid or gas, which creates dense waves that cause obstruction.	nature of a density wave	Explain how nature of a density wave is analogous to traffic jam on a highway.

 Enzymes are analogous to keyhole= a hole in the surface of an object where important chemical reactions take place. This is because enzymes active at one end of the enzyme-ligand complex (the catalytic domain) cleave substrates into smaller molecules, whereas keyhole holes provide access for another enzyme or ligand to bind and do work on the substrate.	enzymes	Explain how enzymes is analogous to key hole.

The human brain has a very large number of individual memories, which can be collectively group together into longer term memories or "tabs" (on a computer, these are called folders).

In a reaction, the rate-determining step is analogous to buying stamps at the post office. The person in front of you gets their hands on the stamp they want, and then someone behind them grabs what they need before the line snags them. This process happens constantly during reactions because it is how most chemists make measurements.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Explain how rate-determining step of a reaction is analogous to buying stamps at the post office, when there is a long line of customers.

If you are waiting in line to buy stamps, the stamp dispenser hands out small batches of stamps at a time. The size and shape of the stamp is determined by how much ink is left in the cartridge.

A rate-determining step in a reaction is analogous to the slowest moving car in traffic. The purpose of this step is to determine how quickly the reactants and products are moving through the reaction vessel. This information can be used to calculate whether the reaction is taking place at a rapid or controlled pace.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Explain how rate-determining step of a reaction is analogous to slowest moving car in traffic.
A rate-determining step of a reaction is analogous to the slowest moving car in traffic. A reactant ( reacting element ) will approach the catalyst at an increasing rate, until the Introducer has been reached and all materials have reacted equally. The speed of this process is determined by how far along the Invoker each atom or molecule is - as it approaches, its movement becomes more constrained by other particles in between. This affects both power and fuel efficiency: As Reactants get closer to the Catalyst they clog up/melt off atoms spots which reduce their mobility and thus their ability to move forward, contributing eventually to decreasedoperated distance per unit time	rate-determining step of a reaction	Explain how rate-determining step of a reaction is analogous to slowest moving car in traffic.
A reaction is analogous to a slow moving car in traffic. When the reactant (gaseous or liquid) and product (solid) are both in contact with each other, their kinetic energies will combine and create heat. The rate at which this happens depends on the collision term: In particular, the speed of the reactants influences how quickly they reach equilibrium; as a result, these terms can be used to calculate equilibrium constants.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Explain how rate-determining step of a reaction is analogous to slowest moving car in traffic.
In traffic, the slowest moving car is the one in front of the speeding car. The rate at which a reaction takes place is determined by the speed and distance between the two substances. In a chemical reaction, there are three rate-determining steps: substrate binding, product assembly, and product elimination. Rate determination depends on these three factors: (1) reactant concentration; (2) catalyst quality; and (3) operating temperature.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Explain how rate-determining step of a reaction is analogous to slowest moving car in traffic.
A rate-determining step in a reaction analogy is like the slowest moving car in traffic. Every time that the car moves, it makes a small impact on the rest of the cars around it--the speed at which the car is traveling impacts how quickly all of the other cars are moving. A similar thing happens with reactions: each time something goes into action (like adding water to vinegar), there's an impact on all of the other molecules inside of that reaction happening simultaneously. This means that when you make changes to how fast you're going during a reaction, those changes also affect everything else happening in that reaction next door--and vice versa.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Explain how rate-determining step of a reaction is analogous to slowest moving car in traffic.
Column chromatography is analogous to separating bees and wasps because it uses Alzheimers patients as test subjects. Column chromatography separates different types of molecules by using a material that falls into an "us-versus-them" format. The more expensive materials fall into the bottom part of the column while the cheaper ones are occupying the top part.	column chromatography	Explain how column chromatography is analogous to separating bees and wasps.
Column chromatography is an analogy to separating bees and wasps because it separates particles that are different colors (bees, blue hives, for example) from one another. Column chromatography also allows for the resolution of weakly resolved compounds by use of a small amount of material in comparison to other constituents.	column chromatography	Explain how column chromatography is analogous to separating bees and wasps.
Column chromatography can be thought of as a way of separating different types of molecules by their ability to interact with one another. In column chromatography, this interaction is done through the use of a material called a resin. The resin separates the molecules into different classes, or groups, based on how easily they are able to react with other materials in the environment. This process is often repeated multiple times until you've gathered all of the desired molecules andclasses that you need.	column chromatography	Explain how column chromatography is analogous to separating bees and wasps.
Column chromatography is similar to separating bees and wasps because it separates the active ingredient from the inactive ingredients. Columns are made of different materials, such as glass or plastic, that can be agitated according to a given protocol to create a physical separation between the active ingredient and its accompanying inert particles.	column chromatography	Explain how column chromatography is analogous to separating bees and wasps.
Column chromatography is a process of mobile material being separated from insoluble stationary material by the adsorption of ancols and other molecules onto the particle surface. The particles are then centrifuged or heated to cause the soluble materials to precipitate, and the aggregates are removed by filtration. Column chromatography is an efficient way to recover high-specificity substances from complex mixtures.	column chromatography	Explain how column chromatography is analogous to separating bees and wasps.
Dynamic chemical equilibrium is analogous to two jugglers. A juggler uses a variety of techniques, including juggling objects and moving them around, to create dynamics that keep the objects in balance. The same principles are used by scientists when measuring stability in dynamic systems.	dynamic chemical equilibrium	Explain how dynamic chemical equilibrium is analogous to two jugglers.
A dynamic chemical equilibrium is equivalent to a juggling act. The two jugglers are trying to maintain an equal balance by changing the amount of weight they carry around with them. They do this by adding and subtracting elements from their balls, which in turn affects how quickly their balls rotate around the mechanisms that control their motion.	dynamic chemical equilibrium	Explain how dynamic chemical equilibrium is analogous to two jugglers.
A dynamic chemical equilibrium is similar to two jugglers. When they are juggling, one juggler will hold a material in their left hand and another juggler will hold a material in their right hand.

This movement of the materials ensures that both players are maintaining their balance and keeping the food within arm's reach.	dynamic chemical equilibrium	Explain how dynamic chemical equilibrium is analogous to two jugglers.
A dynamics model of two jugglers is like a periodically repeating freefall experiment in which the particles in each bag ( subjects ) interact with one another. In equilibrium, all objects will be located at their original positions and gas concentrations will remain unchanged. The model allows us to explore how different parameters— such as displacement rates, mass ratios, and average speeds—can affect Holiday's performance.	dynamic chemical equilibrium	Explain how dynamic chemical equilibrium is analogous to two jugglers.
 Dynamic equilibrium is the process by which two jugglers maintain their balance while juggling. When they juggle, they use a combination of weight and momentum to keep the orbs in contact with each other. By adjusting their arm position and hand movement, they can adjust how much pressure or slipthey put on the orbs. Iguana Dynamics provides an analogy for dynamic chemical equilibrium in terms of jiggling rubber balls: when you toss a ball around your room, you vary its displacement and height (velocity) as it moves through space. Likewise, when we move objects around our classrooms using inertia and impact forces - like moving Rubber Balls - we are constantly adjustingmagnitude (weight) and direction (position), so that each object remains relatively stable over time	dynamic chemical equilibrium	Explain how dynamic chemical equilibrium is analogous to two jugglers.
A vacuole is analogous to a storage bag. The function of the Vacuole is to store water and other materials in solution. When an animal drinks from a Storage Bag, itsacrifices material such as air and bacteria that would be present in the creatinine solution if the bag were made of paper or plastic. A vacuole also has been developed specifically for human ascites by increasing Degussa's level inside the bags over time.	vacuole	Explain how vacuole is analogous to storage bags.
Vacuole is an analogy to storage bags. A vacuole is a container made up of small spaces that can hold nutrients or waste. To create space in the vacuole, nutrients and waste must be combined together. This creates a vacuum, which sucks in air and delivers the nutrients and waste to the cells of your body.	vacuole	Explain how vacuole is analogous to storage bags.
A vacuole is like a storage bag. When you empty your recycling, the shredded materials fall into four different vacuoles. The outermost vacuum tube holds the most material, while the middle Vacuole stores intermediately and the inner Vacuole holds lessmaterial. Finally, there is a hole in the top that lets air escape.	vacuole	Explain how vacuole is analogous to storage bags.
A vacuole is analogous to a storage bag in that it stores the waste products of an organism. The Vacuole is made up of smaller pockets or vesicles where wastes are held before they are eliminated through the permeable membrane and into the environment.	vacuole	Explain how vacuole is analogous to storage bags.
One analogy for vacuole is a storage bag. A storage bag contains items such as clothes, books, or tools. When youliga these items into the proper order and fit them inside the bag, it forms a pouch. This type of packaging helps to protect things from being damaged in transit. The same is true with Vacuole: when particles from other objects are sucked up into the vacuole, it becomes filled with debris.	vacuole	Explain how vacuole is analogous to storage bags.
The analogy between transport vesicles and delivery truck is that both convey goods or passengers to their destination. The difference between transport vesicles and delivery trucks is that transportation vesicles are small, while delivery trucks are large. Transport Vesicles carry a limited amount of an item, whereas delivery vans can hold a much larger quantity.	transport vesicles	Explain how transport vesicles is analogous to delivery truck.
Travelling vesicles are analogous to delivery trucks that transport drugs and other bulky objects. The vesicles contain the drug or other object, and when they reach their destination, they release the content into the environment. Transport vesicles also have a similar structure: They are filled with an enzyme that breaks down the material before it can enter your body.	transport vesicles	Explain how transport vesicles is analogous to delivery truck.
 Transport vesicles are analogous to delivery truck. The transport vesicles carry cargo between cells or other tissues in the body, like a truck delivers goods to a destination. They also have the ability to move large molecules, like proteins and cholesterol, across biological membranes like those around blood vessels.	transport vesicles	Explain how transport vesicles is analogous to delivery truck.
Transport vesicles are analogous to delivery trucks. They allow materials and chemicals to be delivered directly to the intended destination, without needing a port of entry.	transport vesicles	Explain how transport vesicles is analogous to delivery truck.
There are a few key differences between transport vesicles and delivery truck. First, transport vesicles have the ability to move large quantities of cargo quickly and easily. Delivery truck requires more space for loading and unloading cargo, as well as for the trucks themselves to transportation the payloads. Second, transport vesicles generally have larger size compared to release tubes or dumb pouches that deliver vaccines or other medications directly into local areas. Third, transport vesicles do not usually carry oxygen or other gases like air in order to help support life-supporting systems during transit; instead they rely on an organic material (like carbon dioxide) to create buoyancy and keep them afloat until they reach their destination. Finally, Unlike release tube drug trials where all potential participants must be admitted before starting therapy (and often face potential harm if they don't comply), transport vesicle drug trials typically allow anyone who wishes to participate—even those who are unable or unwilling to take medication orally—to do so without fear of harm.	transport vesicles	Explain how transport vesicles is analogous to delivery truck.
 Proto-oncogenes are similar to car accelerator because they can influence the growth or progression of cancer.	proto-oncogenes	Explain how proto-oncogenes is analogous to car accelerator.
 Proto-oncogenes are transcripts of oncogene genes that have been mutated in the process of development.

Oncogenesunky analogy:If an accelerator is stuck in a down position, it won't turn over and give you the power to move forward. On the same note, if one has oncogenes(cancer-causing genes) code that causes their tumors to grow faster than normal, then they will likely have more aggressive tumors as well (they'll be more resistant to chemotherapy).	oncogenes	Explain how oncogenes is analogous to car accelerator stuck in down position.
Oncogenes are analogous to a car accelerator that is stuck in the down position. These proteins code for genes that can make tumors develop.	oncogenes	Explain how oncogenes is analogous to car accelerator stuck in down position.
Oncogenes are analogous to a car accelerator stuck in the down position. They can help increase cancer cell growth, but they also have another function-in addition to helping increase cancer cell growth, oncogenes can help control how these cells grow and spread.	oncogenes	Explain how oncogenes is analogous to car accelerator stuck in down position.
Oncogenes are analogous to a car accelerator that is stuck in the down position. A oncogene can beon ofactivation (1) or overexpression (2). Overexpression, which is more common, results in increased expression of genes encoding proteins that damage the body's cells, such as cancerous cells.	oncogenes	Explain how oncogenes is analogous to car accelerator stuck in down position.
Oncogenes are analogous to the "car accelerator" stuck in the down position. They affect how growth hormones (such as tumor-fighting protein HER2) are transported and distributed around a cell. This can limiting their ability to create new cells, which may lead to cancer development.	oncogenes	Explain how oncogenes is analogous to car accelerator stuck in down position.
Tumor suppressor genes are similar to car brakes in that they control the amount of energy that a tumor can use to grow. These genes help prevent tumors from multiplying too quickly, and also make it easier for doctors to remove these tumors surgically.	tumor suppressor genes	Explain how tumor suppressor genes is analogous to car brakes.
Tumor suppressor genes are analogous to car brakes. They work to keep tumors from growing, by controlling the expression of certain genes. For example, a tumor suppressor gene might control the expression of a gene that helps your body make cancer-fighting drugs.	tumor suppressor genes	Explain how tumor suppressor genes is analogous to car brakes.
Tumor suppressor genes are analogous to car brakes in that they can help stop the growth of tumors. Car brakes work by adding power to the wheel so that it can keep moving forward, which helps to prevent the vehicle from going off course. The same principle applies to tumor suppressor genes: They add power to a person's body so that they can't grow new tumors.	tumor suppressor genes	Explain how tumor suppressor genes is analogous to car brakes.
Tumor suppressor genes are analogous to car brakes. When the brake pads are touched, they send a signal to the engine telling it not to start. The same is true for tumor suppressor genes- when they are touched, they keep the cell in check and do not make it able to grow.	tumor suppressor genes	Explain how tumor suppressor genes is analogous to car brakes.
Tumor suppressor genes are similar to car brakes in that they control the growth of tumors. Car brake controllers decrease the speed at which the engine runs, which reduces the amount of energy it uses and prevents the engine from making too much noise. This is also true for tumor suppressor genes, which prevent cells from multiplying and growing into larger tumors.	tumor suppressor genes	Explain how tumor suppressor genes is analogous to car brakes.
 Software is similar to jenga. When one division of a puzzle falls apart, the other divisions can't figure out how to fix it and they fall apart. The same thing happens with software: when one part breaks, the others have to find another way to use that part.	brittle software	Explain how brittle software is analogous to jenga.
Software is brittle when it's easy to break and the pieces can fall apart easily. This analogy relates software stability to playing Jenga, where different parts of the game can fall apart quite easily if not managed well.	brittle software	Explain how brittle software is analogous to jenga.
Software is a very brittle material. If you try to move it, it breaks into pieces. This analogy explains how software can be compared to jenga. Jenga is a popular game where players place stones on the edge of a pile in order to make them fall down. The morestones that are placed on top of each other, the taller the pile becomes. When one player tries to pick up anstone off the ground and put it back in its original position, the stone has three options: It can land on its own two feet (pictured above), bounce off anotherStone nearby (shown below), or Slippass through both Stones and end up dropping off the cliff onto somebody else's pile!	brittle software	Explain how brittle software is analogous to jenga.
A software program is like a jenga game. When you try to move the pieces, they sometimes fall off the stack but more often stay put. This is because software programs are made up of small modules that can be organized in any way you want and worked on concurrently. If one piece falls off the stack, it usually means that another module in that program has caused the problem.	brittle software	Explain how brittle software is analogous to jenga.
Software is analogy to jenga. When you setting up a new game of the same type, each piece must fit into its appropriate position in order for the game to be played correctly. The same applies to software - each piece needs to fit together in an ordered fashion in order for it to function properly. If something goes wrong and some pieces don't Fit, then the game can crash or even potentially fall apart. In software terms, this analogy would be likened to how pieces of a puzzle fit together perfectly once they're put back in place so that the game can continue playing as intended.	brittle software	Explain how brittle software is analogous to jenga.
Resonance hybrid is an analogy to rhinoceros because they are both creatures that have a hard and thick skin. They also have the ability to roar which can be heard up close.	resonance hybrid	Explain how resonance hybrid is analogous to rhinoceros.
A resonance hybrid is an animal that has a horn and a mouth. The horn is like the end of aomphala, which is a type of woodstick. The mouth is like the tip of antragus, which is a type of nasal bone.	resonance hybrid	Explain how resonance hybrid is analogous to rhinoceros.
 Resonance hybrid is an analogy to rhinoceros. In resonance hybrid, the metal material and plastic are both used in order to create a durable structure that resists wear and tear. This allows for multiple uses and interchangeable parts which saves time and money.	resonance hybrid	Explain how resonance hybrid is analogous to rhinoceros.
Resonance hybrid is analogous to rhinoceros because both animals have a system of resonance. Rhinoceroses have two sets of bones that make up their head and neck, as well as four other bones in their body that are also called "rostes." These rostes create sound waves when the animal talks or how it moves its big, kerplike horns. The way these different types of sounds interact creates a Rhythm Cycling effect. This means that each time an object like a horn or bone strings together two notes with equal speed (or at least near-equal speeds), it causes the back of our ear to go “bang” due to the vibration of those Notes combined!	resonance hybrid	Explain how resonance hybrid is analogous to rhinoceros.
The most analogous animal to the Rhodesian rhinoceros is a resonance hybrid. A resonance hybrid has genes from both the red and white Rhinos. They are considered potentially extinct due to their rarity, but may still be living in some areas.	resonance hybrid	Explain how resonance hybrid is analogous to rhinoceros.
In a dark room, the light from a flashlight reflects off of the surfaces around it. The intensity of this light depends on how close the object is to the light source and also on its shape. When an observer looks at an object in this setting, they see "waveforms" or patterns of reflections that can beimposed by various factors such as surface roughness and size. By analogy, wave mechanical models are analogous to fireflies in that they create waves of light that can be heard and seen with eyes open even in complete darkness.	wave mechanical model	Explain how wave mechanical model is analogous to firefly in a dark room.
The analogy between firefly and wave mechanical model is that afirefly uses light to communicate, whereas waves use energy to communicate. In a dark room,wave mechanical model can be used to see the movement of particles in the air.	wave mechanical model	Explain how wave mechanical model is analogous to firefly in a dark room.
A waves mechanical model is analogous to a firefly in a dark room. The firefly's light emitters and receivers are located at the boundaries of its disk, whereas the wave's nodes are spread throughout its length. This analogy allows for comparisons between fireflies and waves in terms of their structure, behavior and optics.	wave mechanical model	Explain how wave mechanical model is analogous to firefly in a dark room.
Light is thedefault energy source for fireflies, as they use light to see. Wave mechanical models recreate how waves interact with each other to create force and motion in nature. This analogy can help students understand how wave mechanics can be used to model physical phenomena in a dark room.	wave mechanical model	Explain how wave mechanical model is analogous to firefly in a dark room.
Fireflies are light-producing creatures that operate in Dark Rooms. A firefly's body is made up of energy waves that travel through the air and wake up other fireflies to produce light. In contrast, a wave model of mechanical behavior for humans produces similar results in a dark room when trying to understand how people interact with their environment - by using Wave Mechanical models.	wave mechanical model	Explain how wave mechanical model is analogous to firefly in a dark room.
An electroencephalogram (EEG) is like listening to a game. The EEG measures the electrical activity in the brain. This electrical activity can be used to track how somebody is feeling, what they are doing, and how their brain is working.	electroencephalogram	Explain how electroencephalogram is analogous to listening to a game.
It is analogous to listening to a game because both involve the use of electrodes on the scalp. The difference between listening to a game and electroencephalogram is that with respect to games, there are more assistant referees called "game controllers" who help referee the playing field while in real life sound cannot be measured as directly as EEG data can. Electroencephalograms also provide an indirect record of brain waves which makes it possible for scientists to study specific areas of the brain during different activities or mental tasks.	electroencephalogram	Explain how electroencephalogram is analogous to listening to a game.

One common analogy for how electroencephalogram similarity works is to listen to a game. Electroencephalography (EEG) captures the electrical activity of the brain as it occurs, allowing scientists to measure changes in voltage over time. Changes in EEG can be used to track specific points within a game or struggle attempt and provide information about how players are feeling.	electroencephalogram	Explain how electroencephalogram is analogous to listening to a game.
A photocopier machine copies a document by printing out the pages of the document on two sheets of paper. The first sheet is placed over the original document and a light beam comes into contact with it, causing the Pages to photostimulate. Then, because dna replication involves separate pieces of DNA (the pressure also causes them to fuse), each time one piece is copied an extra copy is made which can be viewed as positive or negative depending on what direction you view it from.	dna replication	Explain how dna replication is analogous to photocopier machine.
Dna replication is analogous to photocopier machine. A photocopy machine prints one or more copies of a document using the same Devils Dyad copier principle: two light beams hit the paper simultaneously, and an image is formed on each beam. The copied document can then be saved as a hard copy or sent electronically to another person who has a photocopy machine.	dna replication	Explain how dna replication is analogous to photocopier machine.
Dna replication is analogous to photocopying. When you print out a document, the printer copies all of the text on the paper onto its own memory cartridge. The cartridge then goes into your computer and prints out the document as if it were original text.	dna replication	Explain how dna replication is analogous to photocopier machine.
A photocopier machine copies one type of paper onto another type of paper. DNA replication is just like a photocopier machine - it prints out genetic information (dna) on to receiving cells in order to create new generations of cells.	dna replication	Explain how dna replication is analogous to photocopier machine.
Dna replication is analogous to photocopier machine because it copies information from one point in space to another.	dna replication	Explain how dna replication is analogous to photocopier machine.

Book printing is a process of reproducing complete copies of books from individual sheets of paper. Book printers print one sheet at a time and then cut the pages to their finished size.	dna replication	Explain how dna replication is analogous to book printing.
Dna replication is analogous to book printing. Book printing involves physically cutting out large sheets of paper and then sewing them together using thread.

These small duplexes are then cut down into smaller pieces and sewn back together, creating the finished product.	dna replication	Explain how dna replication is analogous to book printing.
Book printing is a process of transferring paper sheets from one sheet size to another, usually using a press. The same technology can be used to create dna replication discs by cutting the master disc into desired sizes and then pressing them together.	dna replication	Explain how dna replication is analogous to book printing.
Book printing is a process where sheets of paper are folded together and sewn together to create the cover. The pages that make up the book are then printed one at a time, with each page being attached to the previous one using sewing thread.	dna replication	Explain how dna replication is analogous to book printing.
Rna transcription is analogous to language translation because the two are both methods for creating a representation of information in a different form. Rnas can be used to transcribe RNA transcripts, and mRNA can be used to translate words into text.	rna transcription	Explain how rna transcription is analogous to language translation.
Rna transcription is analogous to translation because it helps translate between languages. RNA transcription occurs during the process of assembly of proteins, and transport of genetic information across the cell membrane. Translation may involve various step-by-step processes including mRNA handling and storage, splicing (the modification of aloudsounding mRNAs into long polycistronic products), and mapping transcriptomes onto chromosomes.	rna transcription	Explain how rna transcription is analogous to language translation.
Rna transcription is analogous to language translation because the purpose of both tasks is to put one form of communication into another form. Rna transcriptionists use enzymes to catalyze chemical reactions that convert genetic information into mRNA, which is then translated into words. Translation professionals use special algorithms to translate between languages and create a text that represents the original message in a more specific or objective way.	rna transcription	Explain how rna transcription is analogous to language translation.
Rna transcription is analogous to language translation in that both involve breaking down complex symbols into their component parts. However, while language translation involves understanding the meaning of a sentence and then translating it into another language, rna transcription involves decoding mRNA (molecules made up of RNA) into specific amino acids. This process can be further divided into two categories: core sequencing and transcriptomics. Core sequencing, or basic analysis of genetic material, includes looking at individual genes and identifying which ones are expressed earliest or most frequently. Transcriptomics also focuses on understanding how proteins interact with one another within genomes and Cartilage cells were specifically chosen due to their unique anatomical features	rna transcription	Explain how rna transcription is analogous to language translation.
Rna transcription is analogous to language translation because it involves the copying of a specific sequence of DNA into another form. This process, known as PCR, can be used to create a template from which other people can transcribe the same text using their own unique set of genetic instructions.	rna transcription	Explain how rna transcription is analogous to language translation.
Protein translation is analogous to language translation in that both involve the manipulation of mRNA for encoding protein. However, proteintranslation typically involves a greater number of amino acids being aligned into the correct sequence relative to those used in mRNA Translation. Additionally, several factors must be satisfied before translated proteins can act: the ribosome needs time to translate mRNAs into proteins, and eukaryotic cells store precursor transcripts (mRNA precursors) inside their lysates ready for transcription by cell-specific promoters.	protein translation	Explain how protein translation is analogous to language translation.
There are key similarities between protein translation and languagetranslation. Protein translation involves the ability of a proteins to bind specifically to a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule, which is then translated into text or words. Languagetranslation does not involve the binding of any specific molecules to a messenger RNA; instead, language translations are based on cultural conventions that dictate how certain sounds should be pronounced.	protein translation	Explain how protein translation is analogous to language translation.
Protein translation is analogous to language translation because both involve the279 transfer of information between genetic instructions and RNA. Proteintranslation generally occurs in a closed system, such as a blood vessel or cell, while language translation typically takes place within our brains.	protein translation	Explain how protein translation is analogous to language translation.
Protein translation is analogous to language translation. Protein synthesis takes place in the ribonucleocircle, which contains RNA (ribosomal proteins). The gap between the N-terminus of a protein and its C-terminus forms an open reading frame. This is where the amino acids are located, and this occurs inside of eukaryotic cells duringprotein synthesis. mRNA encoding for proteins is transcribed from these frames, and then translated into amino acids within the cell.	protein translation	Explain how protein translation is analogous to language translation.
Protein translation is analogous to languagetranslation in that the two processes require common Gateway proteins and a certain amount of amino acids. However, whereas protein translation can be implemented in an automatic manner through enzymes, grammar-like rules are typically approved by the human brain before being translated into text or simultaneously interpreted as sound by both ears.	protein translation	Explain how protein translation is analogous to language translation.
A city is a complex system of humans, animals, plants and other elements that together create the environment in which people live. An ecosystem is also a complex system, but it includes only those parts of the natural world that are related to human activity.	ecosystem	Explain how ecosystem is analogous to cities.
The analogy between ecosystems and cities is that the two are both cultures. In ecosystems, there are many different types of life together in a collaborative way. This is true of cities too; they’re usually built on piles of rubble where people used to live. But while ecosystem can often be seen as messy and disorderly, cities also have their own systems in place to manage them: water supplies, transportation, public services—the works.	ecosystem	Explain how ecosystem is analogous to cities.
Ecosystem is an analogy for cities because both have a constantly changing and evolving assemblage of life that interacts with each other. The two differ in their structure (e.g., city is built on the ground while ecosystem is built around plants, animals, and water) but they share a common goal: making it possible for humans to live together in harmony.	ecosystem	Explain how ecosystem is analogous to cities.
In an ecosystem, there are many different types of creatures and plants that live together in harmony. The flowers and trees help to pollinate the fruit of the plants, which helps to generate food for the animals that eat it and add color to the landscape. All these activities create a cycle that keeps everything healthy and functioning well.	ecosystem	Explain how ecosystem is analogous to cities.
An ecosystem is a network of plants and animals that live together in harmony. The term was first coined by Charles Darwin, who introduced it to the world in his 1859 book "The Zoology of Walking over Plants". In ecology, ecosystems are often described as whole systems, rather than just specific parts. They include not only the natural environment around each individual organism or animal (the planet's surface), but also all its surrounding elements- especially those that provide water, food, and oxygen.	ecosystem	Explain how ecosystem is analogous to cities.
When an action potential flows down a neuron, it is analogous to falling dominoes. The topmost dominoes in the chain are the most active and spread the furthest along their respective chains. Next are the lower-dominant cells, which then send out Action Potentials (AP) that travel in smaller arcs until they reach their destination cell. Finally, there may be some cells that don't receive any APs from other cells and simply stop transmitting activity because they've reached their saturation point. This can happen at any given moment duringfalling dominoes: some AP might get through another cell's membrane and fall into nearby storage solution where it will eventually stimulate another neuron; or an inactive A+ could accumulate over time and slowly propagate back up the stack of neurons	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain how propagation of an action potential down a neuron is analogous to falling dominoes.
An action potential is like an interlocking dominoes that fall down the neuron in a chain. The most basic analogy would be to think of each domino as either releasing or blocking another one from falling. This applies to any type of cell communication, whether it's between neurons or muscles.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain how propagation of an action potential down a neuron is analogous to falling dominoes.
When an action potential spreads throughout a neuron, it is analogous to falling dominoes. The dominoes are like tiny electrical impulses that travel down the neuron and ultimately activate other neurons in turn. This chain of actions does not need to be completed in order for the message to reach its destination – any number of small signals can trigger an action potential across a neuron at once.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain how propagation of an action potential down a neuron is analogous to falling dominoes.
An action potential is a nerve impulse that travels along an axon. When it arrives at its destinations, the action potential divides into two bundles (the microelectrode and the post-mitotic cells). The microelectrodes in one bundle record the original energy of the impulse; this energy will be released when you take your next step. similarly, the cell bodies of post-mitotic neurons also release their own sets of catecholamines upon firing an impulse from a neuron. These molecules help to sustain activity during long periods of inactivity or deprivation as well as promote survival after damage	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain how propagation of an action potential down a neuron is analogous to falling dominoes.
Each dominoes falls until the final one is at the bottom. The action potential propagates down a neuron like this, falling each time an ionic neurotransmitter Binding Element (BE) Mutations are made to its membrane protein.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain how propagation of an action potential down a neuron is analogous to falling dominoes.
Breathing Mechanism of Frogs is Analogous to Blowing of Balloon. When a frog breathes in, their lungs fill with air and the gas exchange begins. The frog then exhales using both inhaled gas and exhalated breath. The process repeats until all the oxygen has been used up or until it reaches the atmosphere again.	breathing mechanism of frogs	Explain how breathing mechanism of frogs is analogous to blowing of the balloon.
The breathing mechanism of frogs is analogous to blowing of the balloon. The frog's lungs are adapted to breathe in air and expel it through their mouth. When they inflated the balloon, they were also trying to create a vacuum which will suck in water and produce oxygen.	breathing mechanism of frogs	Explain how breathing mechanism of frogs is analogous to blowing of the balloon.
The breathing mechanism of frogs is analogous to blowing of the balloon. The frogs use their lungs in order to breathe in air and then use their common sense in order to blow that air out through their mouth	breathing mechanism of frogs	Explain how breathing mechanism of frogs is analogous to blowing of the balloon.
Roots and spread of a frog’s limbs is caused by the relaxation of coiled muscles. When it exhales, the frog inhales new air that has been stored in its lungs since before the moment it took breath. The tissue near where the elastic band meets the ribcage snaps back as energy fromthe expired breathe travels through and around these structures- bunching up arterial blood nearby which then flows to other parts of body	breathing mechanism of frogs	Explain how breathing mechanism of frogs is analogous to blowing of the balloon.
The frog's breathing mechanism is analogous to blowing of the balloon. When a frog takes in air through their lungs, it pushes the gas out their mouth and nose. This causes an increase in pressure within the bronchi (veins supplying blood to different parts of the body). Since frogs have no teeth, they must use their tongue which acts as a personal filter to Remove all pollutants before passing them on to their brain.	breathing mechanism of frogs	Explain how breathing mechanism of frogs is analogous to blowing of the balloon.
Layer architecture is analogous to communication with translators. The first layer (the "lingua franca" layer) is theternal source of language, and the second layer interface provides a mechanism for translating that language into another form.	layered architecture	Explain how layered architecture is analogous to communication with translators.
Layer-by-layer communication is analogy to translating a text. A translator takes the raw language and looks for patterns or common words that are shared between different languages. Then, they create a model of how these patterns should be interpreted and translated. Once the model is created, it can be used as an input for another translator to produce gibberish or even perfect English translations from foreign languages.	layered architecture	Explain how layered architecture is analogous to communication with translators.
Layers are analogous to communication with translators. A translator is a machine that translates one language into another, and the layer in which an application runs is akin to the language stack in which a user communicates with a web browser.	layered architecture	Explain how layered architecture is analogous to communication with translators.
Layers in architecture are analogous to the layers of communication a translator uses. The first layer is the physical layer, which provides an interface between the sender and receiver. The next layer down is the protocol level, which contains information about how messages should be formatted and sent. This may include rules that dictate how bytes must be inserted into a message, or special handling for certain types of packets (such as error response codes). Finally, there is the medialayer, whichtransforms digital signals into analog form so they can be transmitted over other media such as voice or video	layered architecture	Explain how layered architecture is analogous to communication with translators.
In both cases, communication is performed between two or more elements. The layers in a layered architecture are analogous to the different levels of communication used with translators. For example, the rooflayer can be thought of as a level above the ground and below the networks that it communicates with. Similarly, the network layer can be seen as an intermediary layer between components on the surface (like microphones) and deeper systems within them (like graphics cards). Finally, there may be other layers beneath this for specific tasks or applications.	layered architecture	Explain how layered architecture is analogous to communication with translators.
In practical terms, limiting reactant and excess reactant is analogous to chocolate distribution. In a recipe that uses a limited amount of reactants (such as sugar and cocoa powder), the heat from the stove vaporizes all of the reaction products so they can be drawn off into the atmosphere easily. However, in cases where there are too many reactive ingredients (like chocolate bars with high levels of caffeine or peak oil content), those volatile molecules may not have time to decompose before being drawn off into the atmosphere by cooking. This means some large molecules will stay put in solution while others are lost forever, leading to a range of inconsistencies and flavors in your final product.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain how limiting reactant and excess reactant is analogous to chocolate distribution.
 Limiting reactant and excess reactant is analogous to chocolate distribution. When making a chocolate cake, the baker puts small pieces of sugar, eggs, butter and vanilla extract in large molds called “boxes”. The mixture is then heated until it boils over (similar to how they make Reactless Chocolate). After boiling over, the liquid is reduced by transferring it into smaller molds such as ramekins or cups. This reduces the amount of liquid left in each container which equals the finished product’s cocoa content (and usually affects how rich and fluffy the cake will be).	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain how limiting reactant and excess reactant is analogous to chocolate distribution.
Chocolate distribution is determined by how much of each type of chocolate your recipe calls for. If you limit reactant, the result will be a smaller amount of each type in the finished product, since all ingredients are used up and no new flavors are created. On the other hand, if you overreact with too much reactant, you'll have an increased percentage of both types in the final product which can lead tooff-flavor and Texture problems.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain how limiting reactant and excess reactant is analogous to chocolate distribution.
LIMITING REACTANT: A limit on reactant alters the way the reaction is carried out in a particular direction. In chocolate, limiting reactant means that all of the diary molecules are utilized to produce new cocoa butter molecules. This limits how much glucose can be produced and results in a more gradual release of bitterness over time.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain how limiting reactant and excess reactant is analogous to chocolate distribution.

A eukaryotic cell is analogous to a working office, where the cells are suspended in an environment of nutrients and water. The cytoplasm contains the genetic information for these cells, while the outer membrane protects them from other organisms and allows them to breathe. Eukaryotic cells can reproduce by dividing their cytoplasm into two or more newcells, which then divide again to create another set of cells.	eukaryotic cell	Explain how eukaryotic cell is analogous to working office.
In eukaryotic cells, the cell membrane is divided into two parts: an apical or upper membrane and a basal or lower membrane.

Inside the cell, each protein molecule has its own pores and septa that allow it to travel between different compartments within the cell.	eukaryotic cell	Explain how eukaryotic cell is analogous to working office.
A prokaryotic cell is analogous to a self-started business. Prokaryotes are cells that lack the protein DNA and use organic molecules called proteins to create new proteins. This creates a blueprint for how prokaryotic cells will develop over time, which makes them more efficient and produces more products than if they were born without this guidance.	prokaryotic cell	Explain how prokaryotic cell is analogous to self started business.
In prokaryotic cells, the cell's machinery is used to produce the protein DNA. The name prokaryotic comes from "proteins," which are small pieces of genetic material that can only be produced by bacteria and other prokaryotes.

There is a lot of difference between cup of coffee granules and limiting reactant. Cup of coffee granules are smaller, and they contain more caffeine than limiting reactant. When you drink cup of coffee granules, the caffeine SHOCKS your system by kicking in immediately - it takes about 60 minutes for the full effects to kick in. However, withLimit Reactant, the reaction can take longer because there are no immediate reactions when you add it to water or juice. Once Limit Reactant has reacted with the water or juice, any further additions will not increase its potency as much since each additional molecule has a lower impact on reaction speed/strength.	limiting reactant	Explain how limiting reactant is analogous to a cup of coffee granules.
The limiting reactant is analogous to coffee granules in that it has a finite amount of reactants. Larger molecules such as oxygen and hydrogen gas can exchange electrons with other molecules, while smaller molecules (such as water) cannot.

Zipper is a sewing machine with 6 needles. Helicase has 10aturization and 5 helicases The ingredients of an enzyme are its active site, the substrate, and an inhibitor. In zip, each stitch in the zipper occupies one hole on the working surface of the fabric. The active site mediates binding of substrate to this hole which causes it to close; however, there may be some free space between stitches due to various factors like movement or tension from the material around it (the lining). This "free space" is then filled by another stitch created by complementary sisters using beta-sheets arranged in a zinc finger fashion (see figure 2 ).	helicase	Explain how helicase is analogous to zipper zip.
Helicase is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of a DNA duplex into two copies. Zip is a zipper-like protein that Brown and his colleagues first identified in zebrafish, but has also been found in other species. Helicase shares some similarities with zip: both enzymes are proteins and they catalyze the hydrolysis of DNA duplexes into two equivalent products. But helicase also contains one important difference: helicases can localize to specific sites on their substrate, whereas zip only works when its target is located at the surface of the cell.	helicase	Explain how helicase is analogous to zipper zip.
Zipper is a type of Costume jewelry that consists of two or more layers that fit together like a zipper. The top layer opens and the bottom layer covers it.

A tree's age calculation is analogous to coral's age determination. Coral growth rates are determined by the temperature, light and water availability. The same climate and light conditions that affect tree growth also affect coral development.	tree's age calculation	Explain how tree's age calculation is analogous to coral's age calculation.
Tree's age calculation is analogous to coral's age calculation. Coral can live for many hundred years, but when it dies its coral skeleton will break down into small pieces that can be collected by seagulls and other scavengers. The same happens with a tree: over time the trunk, branches, leaves and roots will decay and replace each other; eventually the tree will die.	tree's age calculation	Explain how tree's age calculation is analogous to coral's age calculation.
Glycolysis is a keyword used to describe the breakdown of glucose into lactic acid and pyruvate.roller coasters are typically amusement park rides that encourage riders to turn around multiple times and "ride" the coaster down hill. Glycolysis is similar to this because it allows for people to break down food into small pieces so they can eat it while on the ride	glycolysis	Explain how glycolysis is analogous to roller coaster.
Glycolysis is the process that breaks down glucose into two molecules of glucose and one molecule of pyruvate. This solution can be used for energy or for other purposes. Roller coasters have four sets of cars that go around a track, but glycolysis simply happens in your body as you use carbohydrates to make energy.	glycolysis	Explain how glycolysis is analogous to roller coaster.
Glycolysis is an analogy to roller coaster. The two activities are both types of amusement park rides.glycolysis is the process that causes sugar molecules to break down into glucose and H2O, while roller coaster involves speeding up or slowing down the movement of a person on a track.	glycolysis	Explain how glycolysis is analogous to roller coaster.
A glycolysis is a process in which one molecule of glucose is broken down into two molecules of lactic acid. This occurs because the blood sugar (sugar) called insulin molecules help to shuttle energy from the liver to muscles.	glycolysis	Explain how glycolysis is analogous to roller coaster.
A glycolysis is an enzymatic process that breaks down carbohydrates into pyruvate and carbon dioxide. This happens as glucose flows through the enzyme complex from a sugar molecule to one of the oxygen atoms in pyruvate.	glycolysis	Explain how glycolysis is analogous to roller coaster.
When two objects collide, it is the force of collision that causes energy to be felt. This energy can then be used to push or pull both objects. The object with more energy Plaza will always exert a greater amount of pressure and will hit the ground first. However, if the anti-stokes scattering is doing its job correctly, there should never be any contact between these two objects because they have different energies.	anti-stokes scattering	Explain how anti-stokes scattering is analogous to ball striking a plate.
The analogy betweenAnti-Stokes scattering and ball striking a plate is that anti-stokes scattering is analogous to hitting a surface with an object. When you hit the surface, your body's motion creates forced vibrations which scatter light in all directions. This behavior also applies when an object is struck by another object - if the two objects are close together they will both cause some waves of sound to be scattered as well.	anti-stokes scattering	Explain how anti-stokes scattering is analogous to ball striking a plate.
An anti-stokes scattering experiment looks like a ball striking a plate. The more diffuse the light, the more scattered it will be. This is why indirect sunlight is scattery, because it's not focused perfectly on one surface.	anti-stokes scattering	Explain how anti-stokes scattering is analogous to ball striking a plate.
If a ball is struck by a Scholar, the physics of anti-stokes scattering will be similar. The Scholar should try to avoid striking the plate with their hand!	anti-stokes scattering	Explain how anti-stokes scattering is analogous to ball striking a plate.
The analogy between anti-stokes scattering and ballstrike is that in both cases there is a physical interaction taking place. In Anti-Stokes Scattering, the scattered light waves are directed away from the incident light wave(s). Ballstriking a plate causes an acoustic shock which returns energy to the striking object.	anti-stokes scattering	Explain how anti-stokes scattering is analogous to ball striking a plate.
Stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate. The main difference is that the waves generated by both types of objects are traveling in different directions, which makes it difficult to determine their location.	stokes scattering	Explain how stokes scattering is analogous to ball striking a plate.
Stokes scattering is analogous to ball striking a plate. The two phenomena are caused by the action of particles inversely proportional to the square of their distance from the object. When an isotropic particle (a particle with no shape or size) strikes an obstacle, it scatters its energy in all directions equally. This is why objects that are far away tend to look like points rather than round pieces when viewed from close up: every point on the object has exactly the same amount of scattered energy. In contrast, when a stokes scatter entity makes contact with something else, some of that entity's energy will be reflected off whatever it hit and scattered in all directions.	stokes scattering	Explain how stokes scattering is analogous to ball striking a plate.
Stokes scattering is analogous to ball striking a plate. When a rock or other object is hit by an outside force, the sudden change in momentum causes the energy of the object to scatter widely and quickly across a wide area. This occurs because all objects have mass (and thus inertia), and as each object moves around it, its momentum changes and some of that motion dissipates into surrounding air or water molecules (that are free to move) while others stay at rest on the surface of the impactObject(s). Because these scattered particles are so small, they cannot cause any damage nor do they contribute significantly to radiant energy passing through surfaces.	stokes scattering	Explain how stokes scattering is analogous to ball striking a plate.
Stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate. When you hit a hard surface with an object, the impact creates noise and powder residues on the surface. The same principle applies to fluids and particles when they are scattered in air or water.	stokes scattering	Explain how stokes scattering is analogous to ball striking a plate.
Stokes scattering is analogous to ball striking a plate. The contacting surfaces of two objects are Kc-Osc (kinetic energy) and Pd-Cl (pressure). When the ball hits the plate, there is an impulse(I) due to the kinetic energy of the ball and a second impact(J) caused by the pressure difference between both object surfaces. This coupled system produces striped patterns on either side of where they hit as illustrated in Figure 2.	stokes scattering	Explain how stokes scattering is analogous to ball striking a plate.
Median lethal dose is the concentration of a substance at which 50% of all fatal doses are delivered. Targeting a specific area with a weapon results in lower median lethal doses because less drug gets to the target, resulting in smaller numbers of fatalities.	median lethal dose	Explain how median lethal dose is analogous to balls and target.
The median lethal dose (MLD) is an adhesive measure of the percentage of deaths caused by a particular poison to all those treated. It provides a rough idea as to what level of toxicity is required in order for one person to succumb. The MLD was developed in the early 1900s and it has been used periodically ever since, most recently in 2006.	median lethal dose	Explain how median lethal dose is analogous to balls and target.
Median lethal dose is often compared to balls and target. A ball has a much smaller radius of impact than a target, so it takes more force to hit the ball than a human. This difference in size makes it difficult for humans to hit targets at very close range, which accounts for why most bullets fired from firearms kill only about half their intended victims. The same holds true for median lethal doses – guns can inflict high levels of lethality even when shooting small prey like rabbits or squirrels.	median lethal dose	Explain how median lethal dose is analogous to balls and target.
Median lethal dose is a measure of the amount that a particular substance can kill in one million session. For example, if you are shooting at a target and take aim at its center with an ammunition belt carrying fifty rounds each, your median lethal dose would be forty-five rounds.	median lethal dose	Explain how median lethal dose is analogous to balls and target.
Median lethal dose is analogous to balls and target. The median lethal dose is the amount of a toxin that will kill 50% of all rats exposed to it. This value was determined by multiplying the rat weight in grams by the number of rats per 100 grams, divided by 10,000.	median lethal dose	Explain how median lethal dose is analogous to balls and target.
Universe analogy: A balloon is inflated with air until it has a very high pressure. Then, the balloon’s surface is stretched in all directions by the force of gravity.	universe	Explain how universe is analogous to surface of a balloon.
A universe is analogous to a surface of a balloon. The inside of the balloon is full of air and the outside is filled with space. When you inflated the balloon, you added more air to the inside. This process happens in our own cosmos when we add new particles to the Cosmos through our imaginations. We are adding new dimensions to reality by creating time, space, and other physical forces!	universe	Explain how universe is analogous to surface of a balloon.
Universe is analogous to the surface of a balloon. A balloon has a relatively large volume compared to its height, and so it rises up until its pressure increases to the point at which it bursts. The same applies to the universe- there are vast areas that remain unknown or unexplored, but because our human understanding of space is limited, we can only develop hypotheses about what may be out there.Similarly, humans have only scratched the surface when it comes to exploring all aspects of reality- much remains undiscovered and mysterious. So as humanity keeps learning more and more about Universe, her knowledge will continue expanding until eventually she discovers everything in FFG!	universe	Explain how universe is analogous to surface of a balloon.
The universe is analogous to the surface of a balloon. The space inside the balloon is filled with countless particles and energy, while the outside of the balloon has nothing in it. When you look at or touch the Balloon, something is happening internally that’s not happening on Earth; when you look out at the world around us from within our balloons – looking up through a lens – we see an endless amount of phenomena going on all around us at much higher speeds than what we can Mathieu Caniel observe from down here. There are many more things going on in and around our galaxy than we could possibly count or measure!	universe	Explain how universe is analogous to surface of a balloon.
Universe is analogous to a balloon. When you press down on the top of a balloon, it expands. The same thing happens with our universe- when we push down on its surface, it will expand in all directions.	universe	Explain how universe is analogous to surface of a balloon.
Enzyme mechanism is analogous to lock and key. Enzymes are proteins that catalyze chemical reactions in the body, just like keys are used to open locks. The difference between a key and an enzyme is that an enzyme can be reused many times, whereas a key cannot be recycled.	enzyme mechanism	Explain how enzyme mechanism is analogous to lock and key.
The enzyme mechanism analogy can be used to understand how a lock and key work. When you push a door open with your hand, the muscles in your arm are working like the enzymes in a lock. The same is true when you use an enzyme to digest food- it creates concomitant changes in the environment that allow the other molecules (pectins) inside of the stomach to combine and form codeine. By doing this, we create an effective means of deterring evil spirits from entering our house by inhibiting their ability to enter through any one opening.	enzyme mechanism	Explain how enzyme mechanism is analogous to lock and key.
The analogy is not perfect, as enzyme mechanisms are usually more like keys and locks than simple cogs in a machine. But they do have some resemblance. In both cases, the key or lock needs to be inserted into the correct place in order to unlock the door or chamber. The same goes for enzymes- they need to be correctly put into action in order to create desired results.	enzyme mechanism	Explain how enzyme mechanism is analogous to lock and key.
The two examples of how enzyme mechanism is analogous to lock and key are the process of chemical reactions and the use of keys. In both cases, reactions take place between molecules that have different atoms in them. The shapes of these molecules can affect how these reactions occur, so enzyme mechanisms work like locks that allow different substances to interact with each other without letting anything escape.	enzyme mechanism	Explain how enzyme mechanism is analogous to lock and key.
 Enzyme mechanism analogy is to compare the role of a key and lock. A key has a particular function, such as unlocking a door. The lock functions like an enzyme, which can catalyze or covalently couple chemical reactions in the body so that something can be achieved.	enzyme mechanism	Explain how enzyme mechanism is analogous to lock and key.

Anova is a type of data analysis that allows you to compare the difference between different groups of data. Anova compares how often each group makes certain comparisons and then calculates the average or standard deviation for each comparison to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference.	anova	Explain how anova is analogous to finding signal in the noise.
Anova is a statistic that allows you to find the difference between two sets of data. It is analogous to finding signal in the noise, which means that it can help you identify differences in data that may be smaller than what was observed by chance.	anova	Explain how anova is analogous to finding signal in the noise.
Anova is similar to finding a signal in the noise because it allows you to compare groups of data according to their relative changes. The advantage of using anOVA over other methods, such as q-tests or Paired t-tests, is that it can provide statistical information about the pattern of change across different groups of data.	anova	Explain how anova is analogous to finding signal in the noise.

Water level in a dam is adjustable to ensure that the water flow into and out of the dam is constant. The water balance inside the dam can be controlled by adjusting the depth of prohibition or installing gates that close when an upstream flood arrives. On a lake, there are usually outlets at different levels. Each outlet brings freshwater to one side while saltwater flows away from it. These exchanges happen constantly because water moves across ridges and channels within lakes and rivers Get more information ►	chemical equilibrium	Explain how chemical equilibrium is analogous to water level in dam and lake.
Water level in dam and lake are controlled by the outflow of water from the main stem. The amount of water that is released from a source (such as an airport) is called back flow, while the amount coming into the pond or reservoir is called inflow. Chemical equilibrium occurs when one elementlimited to this concentration at its original point in space and time becomes more diluted than all other elements present. This imbalance causes a change in behavior because molecules become faster or more slow to react with each other, leading to changes in eflSsion concentrations, physical properties (thickness, Liquidity), and chemical reactions.	chemical equilibrium	Explain how chemical equilibrium is analogous to water level in dam and lake.
Water level in dam and lake are controlled by the height of the water above the emblems on either side. Chemical equilibrium is maintained when all chemical elements or compounds have their concentrations at a specific levels. The components of an ecosystem act like molecules to keep balances within the system and this analogy would be more accurate if one were discussing how ecosystems work in general rather than just dams and lakes.	chemical equilibrium	Explain how chemical equilibrium is analogous to water level in dam and lake.
Chemical equilibrium refers to the relationship between two chemicals in an environment. The level of one chemical in a fluid is always lower than the level of the other chemical, because each molecule has a specific ratio of its atoms to other atoms in that material. This means that if you added more water to potassium chloride (KCl), it would raise the concentration of KCl above what was found in salt water. Similarly, adding more sulfur dioxide (SO2) will decrease the concentration of SO2 below what was found by taking air at ISO 8280 atmospheric pressure and letting it cool until saturation occurred.	chemical equilibrium	Explain how chemical equilibrium is analogous to water level in dam and lake.
Chemical equilibrium is analogous to water level in a dam or lake. The two types of objects are at different levels because the chemical reaction between them has changed the composition of these objects. This happens when one object creates an imbalance that can be corrected by adding another object to create a new balance.	chemical equilibrium	Explain how chemical equilibrium is analogous to water level in dam and lake.
Just-in-time is a manufacturing process that uses items in time to produce the desired product.

Just-in-time is similar to water and rocks because they are all physical objects that come in packages. Just-in-time systems use schedules to predict when goods will be available and then produce the goods when they become available.  Rock production is also done using schedules, but it involves different ingredients that must be combined in a specific order for a result that looks like a rock.	just-in-time	Explain how just-in-time is analogous to water and rocks.

Ohm's law is derived from the principle of classical mechanics. In classical mechanics, a particle (such as an electron) has mass and inertia. These laws state that when two objects try to move together in a straight line, the combined weights of the particles will cause them to move in a circle. The same principles can be applied to other physical situations by adding one or more variables such as speed, angle or force.

Transcription is a process of copying large amounts of text from one medium (a book, scribble on a piece of paper) to another. The largest difference between transcription and photocopy is that transcription typically involves taking down large portions of the text while photocopying copies just small snippets.	transcription	Explain how transcription is analogous to photocopying.
Transcription is similar to photocopying because it copies text from a source. However, transcription is done on an outline instead of a full document. This gives the transcriber more control over where and when the text is copied, which can make for faster and accurate transcriptions.	transcription	Explain how transcription is analogous to photocopying.
Rna polymerase is analogous to a Xerox machine in that it can produce copies of genetic information.

Electric circuits are analogous to airflows through tubes. Electric current flows through a tube in the same way that aircurrent flow through a pipe. The difference is that electric current does not go back and forth like aircurrent does, it circles around the wholetube multiple times!	electric circuit	Explain how electric circuit is analogous to air flowing through a tube.
Electric circuit analogy can be drawn to think of an electric current through a tube. Air flows through the tube in all directions, but as it travels down the tube it encounters resistance ( obstacles) every time it passes by. This resistance causes air pressure to build up inside thetube and this pressure makes travelling further up or downwards difficult. The same principle applies to electric circuits; when electricity is passed through them, areas with higher voltages will be confronted with more resistances, which in turn means that there's more power available at these points than those around lower voltages	electric circuit	Explain how electric circuit is analogous to air flowing through a tube.
Electric circuits are analogy to air flow through a tube. Electric current flows in cycles, just like air does within a pipe.

Electric circuits are analogous to ropes through metal rings because the wires in an electric circuit are threaded through metal objects. When a current flows through the wire, it creates sparks that can be seen by someone looking at the wire from near the end of the chain.

A electric current flows through a metal ring when two copper wires are connected. The wire that is nearest the ground (the black Wire) charges the capacitor on the other wire which then boosts (stores) electricity in the capacitor until it needs to be used again. In analogy, an electric current flows through cables in a circuits between electrodes where there is always some kind of connection between one electrode and another. This allows for feedback so that if something goes wrong with either electrode you can quickly correct it by changing oranking of the component around which this current travels!	electric circuit	Explain how electric circuit is analogous to rope through metal rings.
When hydrophobic groups are present on a molecule, they decrease the ability of water toattach itself to other molecules. This is due to thecrowding effect: when there is too much hydrophobicity within a molecule, it becomes difficult for water (and other chemicals) to attach themselves properly and protect the molecule from destruction.	hydrophobic effect	Explain how hydrophobic effect is analogous to teenagers at a party.
When a person is hydrophobic, they tend to prefer colder surfaces over warmer ones. This can be seen in teenagers at a party as they are more likely to stand on the sidelines or near the edge of the room, rather than get up and mix.	hydrophobic effect	Explain how hydrophobic effect is analogous to teenagers at a party.

 Biological signals transduction is analogous to threat communication in animals because both processes involve the exchange of information between two or more cells. In biological signal transmission, a stimulus (such as an electric shock) can activate and conduct electrical current through nerve cells in the brain. This current can then cause changes in gene expression within these cells, which can be interpreted as a warning from the cell's controller	biological signal transduction	Explain how biological signal transduction is analogous to threat communication in animals.
Biological signal transduction is similar to threat communication in animals, because both rely on the exchange of energy between cells and organisms. Biological signals can either warn an organism of a danger or stimulate an organism to take action.	biological signal transduction	Explain how biological signal transduction is analogous to threat communication in animals.
Biological signal transduction is analogous to threat communication in animals. A biological agent or toxin can cause athreat to appear on the surface of an animal, such as when a venomous snake presents its fangs for attack. Theanimalmightreactby displayingcombat readiness and defense behaviors, which couldat least partly protect itself from harm.Likewise, biological agents or toxins might alsocause Surprise Attack Behavior if they are detected by animoan without being aware of its own defenses.	biological signal transduction	Explain how biological signal transduction is analogous to threat communication in animals.
Biological signal transduction is analogous to threat communication in animals. When a biological agent such as a virus or insect enters an animal, the body sends out signals that tell the animal what the bug or virus looks like and how serious it is. Theanimal then decides whether or not to fight off the bug or virus.	biological signal transduction	Explain how biological signal transduction is analogous to threat communication in animals.
