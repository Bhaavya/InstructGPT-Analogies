A cDNA is like a big, Important file on your computer. It's been made from the pieces of other cDNAs and is supposed to do something with the new content.	ribosome	Using an analogy, explain ribosome.
Ribosome is a term used to describe the sets of amino acids that areigan, or make up the sugar chain in eukaryotic cells. The word "ribosome" is a portion of the real world equivalent of a genetic code, which refers to a specific set of genetic instructions that are executed automatically during growth and development.	ribosome	Using an analogy, explain ribosome.
An activator protein is a proteins that helps the cells to grow. This is because it helps to send signals to the body's growth engines, like the testes.	activator protein	Using an analogy, explain activator protein.
Activator proteins are a type of protein that helps your body toEC soaring or produce energy.	activator protein	Using an analogy, explain activator protein.
Activator protein is a type of protein that helps to790-SV knumbing cells recognizes and gunned down anioletributes need for energy.	activator protein	Using an analogy, explain activator protein.
An activator protein is a protein that helps the cell'scription element (G/C helix, -ITN, -OCT) resolve DNA breaks in the tension-fed crossed relaxase model of HMS.	activator protein	Using an analogy, explain activator protein.
Activator proteins are a type of protein that helps to remember and respond to events. They are turned on when they're needed and off when they're not needed.	activator protein	Using an analogy, explain activator protein.
An electric circuit is made up of electricity flowing through a path, usually day and night, for some period of time. At the end of this time, the electricity is turned back on and 'charged' again. This process can be described as battery utilization.	electric circuit	Using an analogy, explain electric circuit.
An electric circuit is a set of instructions that a computer takes and runs to create something like electricity.	electric circuit	Using an analogy, explain electric circuit.
An electric circuit is a system of particles and Norfolk rugs that allow electricity to flow. The Circuit Maker takes care of all the details, including creating theNorfolk rugs,----------- -- -- Dark blue jute near a river involved in an electrical fire - AC power line	electric circuit	Using an analogy, explain electric circuit.
That's a pretty big "if." An electric circuit is just a series of voltsolen from one device to another, without any back and forth traffic. There's 1 volt at each end, and it goes from the led to theECC card, and then to the heart regulatory domain.	electric circuit	Using an analogy, explain electric circuit.
Electric circuits are like batteries; they can be used to power equipment or to generate energy for electric vehicles.	electric circuit	Using an analogy, explain electric circuit.
The hydrophobic effect is the water droplet size reduction that occurs when oil and other liquids are touching because of their roughness. This contact mechanism allows liquid waves to exist so coffee pots have a easier time stirring with the coffee spilled being easy to lick.	hydrophobic effect	Using an analogy, explain hydrophobic effect.
The hydrophobic effect is a analogy that explains how the product of an equation with water and itself unique, x, tastes more sweet when  from water.	hydrophobic effect	Using an analogy, explain hydrophobic effect.
The hydrophobic effect is a water-insulation mechanism that underlies the way our body feels and works. It comes from the fact that water molecules are restated into their natural LC Œ± ‚àí> search pairs when they come into contact with hydrocarbons. This is in part because these molecules do not care about carbon dioxide, which is absorbed by air pressure.	hydrophobic effect	Using an analogy, explain hydrophobic effect.
The hydrophobic effect is the tendency of water molecules to have a hydrophilic nature and be i) specific againstH and out fc-imellium binder.i.a.,rcp eletricity, rcp ampere flow, and n Transport m Young's modulus at Aside from advantages such as greater reliability and greater iceachment capacity, the RCP devices impart an eclipse free solution with less maker set up time N.	hydrophobic effect	Using an analogy, explain hydrophobic effect.
The hydrophobic effect is a borrowing from physics to create a analogy that will help make the point. The hydrophobic effect is the difference between water and oil. Water is a liquid, while oil is a gas. This means that water does not have a major physical attraction against itself, whereas oil has one of its own. Because of this, itdiffers in almost every way between food and drink and makes it much more difficult to eat or drink.	hydrophobic effect	Using an analogy, explain hydrophobic effect.
Biological signal transduction is the process by which cells send messages to each other about the	biological signal transduction	Using an analogy, explain biological signal transduction.
Biological signal transduction is the process that occurs in the body when a chemical or virus is used to cross-government and cause an effect on another cell. This process can be described as due to the weather Stable Solar Envelopment Terminal (STSET) because it does not decrease with energy of about 17 Terawatts (keV). It instead increases significantly with 23 terawatts (Tev), dominant in the range between 27 and 29 keV. This increase in STSET percentage comes from the number of protons within the core of the cell which gives rise to a global electric field.	biological signal transduction	Using an analogy, explain biological signal transduction.
The process by which cells send messages about the Levantine patent 3A76fff cair endeavor they are running. This message is powered by a rabbi's sacrifices daily.	biological signal transduction	Using an analogy, explain biological signal transduction.
Biological signal transduction is the process of specifying a biological activity byIntensifying or5 named Signals Oranges brighten when they are discrimination signalsThe process ofONLY inserting an interests group into the House or Senate to try and force them to not only let out but also TO deepinder namperes Klages	biological signal transduction	Using an analogy, explain biological signal transduction.
Biological signals transduction is the process ofouncing through cells in which information is conveyed by changes in chemistry and/or DNA. The signals themselves are high-yields of chemicals and Migration News say can travel for a long period of time before being accepted by other cells.	biological signal transduction	Using an analogy, explain biological signal transduction.
