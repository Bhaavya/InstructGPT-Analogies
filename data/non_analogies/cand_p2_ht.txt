Adaptive immunity is the branch of immunity that arises as a result of exposure to an antigen, either through natural infection or vaccination. Adaptive immunity involves the generation of antibodies and T cells that specifically recognize and bind to the antigen, leading to its destruction.	adaptive immunity	What is adaptive immunity?
The immune system recognizes and responds to specific pathogens while leaving the body’s own tissues and cells unharmed. The adaptive arm of immunity is kick-started by infection or vaccination, leading to the generation of memory cells that remember how to fight that particular pathogen if it comes back.	adaptive immunity	What is adaptive immunity?
Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the potential difference across the two points. The constant of proportionality is called resistance.	ohm's law	What is ohm's law?
Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the potential difference across the two points.	ohm's law	What is ohm's law?
Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference across it, and inversely proportional to its resistance.	ohm's law	What is ohm's law?
Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the potential difference across the two points.	ohm's law	What is ohm's law?
Ohm's law is a statement that describes the relationship between electric current, voltage, and resistance in an electrical circuit. It states that the current through a conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference (voltage) across it, and inversely proportional to its resistance.	ohm's law	What is ohm's law?
Transcription is the process of converting sound into text.	transcription	What is transcription?
Transcription is the process of turning a strand of RNA into a corresponding strand of DNA. This occurs in the cell's nucleus, where the RNA is first transcribed into a molecule called pre-mRNA. Pre-mRNA contains regions that will become either protein coding regions or regulatory regions. These regions are then "edited" to remove non-coding sequences and create mature mRNA. Mature mRNA is then transported out of the nucleus and translated into protein by ribosomes.	transcription	What is transcription?
Transcription is the process of copying text from one source into another, typically by a machine.	transcription	What is transcription?
The process of transcription is the conversion of genetic information from one form to another. This may be the conversion of DNA into RNA, or the conversion of mRNA into a protein.	transcription	What is transcription?
Transcription is the conversion of written or spoken words into a format that can be read by computers.	transcription	What is transcription?

A ribosome is a type of protein found in all living cells. It helps to create new proteins by reading the genetic instructions encoded in DNA and assembling the amino acids into chains that make up proteins.	ribosome	What is ribosome?
Ribosomes are the organelles in cells that produce proteins.	ribosome	What is ribosome?
A ribosome is a small, round particle found in all cells. It is made of RNA and protein and helps to create proteins.	ribosome	What is ribosome?
Ribosomes are the site of protein synthesis in cells. They are composed of two subunits, a small and a large, that fit together like pieces of a puzzle. The ribosome binds to mRNA (molecules that carry genetic instructions from DNA) and uses the information encoded in the mRNA sequence to create proteins.	ribosome	What is ribosome?
Ribosomes are tiny, round structures found inside cells. They play an important role in the process of protein synthesis, which is how new proteins are made from amino acids. Ribosomes consist of two subunits: a small one and a large one. The small subunit binds to messenger RNA (mRNA), which carries the genetic instructions for making a particular protein. The large subunit then links together individual amino acids to form the protein chain.	ribosome	What is ribosome?
Activator protein is a transcription factor that binds to the promoter region of a gene and increases its expression.	activator protein	What is activator protein?
A protein that is required for the activation of another protein.	activator protein	What is activator protein?
Activator protein is a molecule that helps to activate other proteins, often by binding to them and helping to initiate or regulate their activity.	activator protein	What is activator protein?
Activator protein is a transcription factor that binds to DNA and activates the transcription of specific genes.	activator protein	What is activator protein?
Activator protein is a transcription factor that helps to activate genes. It binds to specific DNA sequences in the genome and recruits other proteins that help to turn on gene expression.	activator protein	What is activator protein?

The hydrophobic effect is the tendency of nonpolar molecules to aggregate in water.	hydrophobic effect	What is hydrophobic effect?
The hydrophobic effect is the tendency of nonpolar molecules to aggregate in an aqueous environment. This occurs because polar molecules, which are attracted to water, interfere with the interaction between nonpolar molecules.	hydrophobic effect	What is hydrophobic effect?
A hydrophobic effect is an interaction between water molecules and nonpolar molecules. In the absence of a hydrophobic effect, water would be evenly dispersed throughout the solution, but because of the hydrophobic effect, water clusters around nonpolar molecules.	hydrophobic effect	What is hydrophobic effect?
The hydrophobic effect is the attractive force between molecules that are not able to mix with water. Hydrophobic molecules tend to clump together, while hydrophilic molecules (ones that like to associate with water) remain separate. This effect is responsible for the self-assembly of proteins and DNA, as well as for the separation of oil and water in droplets.	hydrophobic effect	What is hydrophobic effect?
The hydrophobic effect is a phenomenon that describes the behavior of molecules in a solution. In general, molecules that are attracted to water (hydrophilic) tend to move away from each other, while those that are not attracted to water (hydrophobic) tend to move closer together. This creates an ordered structure within the solution known as a “phase separation”.	hydrophobic effect	What is hydrophobic effect?
Biological signal transduction is the process by which a chemical or physical stimulus is converted into a cellular response. This can involve changes in gene expression, enzyme activity, or membrane potential.	biological signal transduction	What is biological signal transduction?
The process of converting an extracellular signal, such as a hormone or neurotransmitter, into a cellular response. This is done by proteins called receptors that are embedded in the cell membrane. The receptor binds to the signaling molecule and initiates a series of intracellular events that lead to the desired response.	biological signal transduction	What is biological signal transduction?
Biological signal transduction is the process by which a molecule in one part of a cell communicates with other molecules in that or another cell to initiate a change in the physiology of the cells.	biological signal transduction	What is biological signal transduction?
Biological signal transduction is the process by which a biological signal is converted into an intracellular response. This can be done through a variety of mechanisms, including receptor-mediated pathways, second messenger systems, and protein phosphorylation cascades.	biological signal transduction	What is biological signal transduction?
