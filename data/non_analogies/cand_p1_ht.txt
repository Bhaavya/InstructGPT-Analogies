The action potential is an electrical signal that travels along a nerve fiber. It begins when an excitatory stimulus opens voltage-gated Na+ channels and causes Na+ ions to flow into the neuron. This increases the neuron's membrane potential, which eventually reaches a threshold value. When the threshold is reached, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels open and Ca2+ ions flood into the neuron. This triggers an action potential that travels down the nerve fiber until it reaches another synapse.	action potential	Explain action potential.
The action potential is the electrical signal that travels down the axon of a neuron. This electrical signal is created by the movement of ions across the cell membrane. The action potential begins with an influx of sodium ions into the neuron, which creates a positive charge inside the cell. This positive charge then spreads to neighboring cells, creating an action potential that travels down the axon.	action potential	Explain action potential.
When a neuron is stimulated, it sends an electrical signal down its axon. This signal is called an action potential. An action potential is created when the membrane of a neuron becomes Excitable. This means that the neuron has reached its threshold voltage. When the threshold voltage is reached, sodium ions start to flow into the neuron through ion channels. The influx of Na+ ions makes the inside of the neuron more positive (+60mV). This change in voltage causes potassium ions to flow out of the neuron and down its axon (K+ efflux). As more and more potassium ions leave, the inside of the neuron becomes less positive (-80mV). This change in polarity opens up new ion channels that allow sodium ions to rush back into the cell (re-polarization), which creates another action potential.	action potential	Explain action potential.
The action potential is a propagating electrical signal that travels down an axon. It is generated by the activation of voltage-gated Na+ channels and results in the opening of more channels, which allows additional Na+ ions to flow into the neuron. This causes the membrane potential to increase until it reaches a threshold, at which point the neuron fires an action potential. The action potential then travels down the axon and triggers the release of neurotransmitters at synapses.	action potential	Explain action potential.
An action potential is a sudden change in the electrical properties of a neuron that allows it to send a signal to other neurons. The signal is caused by the opening and closing of voltage-gated ion channels, which allow ions (such as sodium and potassium) to flow into or out of the neuron. This influx of ions causes the neuron to fire, sending an electrical signal down its axon and on to other neurons.	action potential	Explain action potential.

Action potentials originate from the dendrite of a neuron and propagate down the axon to the synaptic terminals. The action potential is generated when voltage-gated sodium channels open and allow Na+ ions to flow into the cell. This influx of Na+ ions causes the membrane potential to reach threshold, triggering an action potential that propagates down the axon. At each node of Ranvier, there are additional voltage-gated sodium channels that allow for saltatory conduction of the action potential.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron.
The action potential begins at the dendrite of a neuron. When an electrical signal arrives, it causes voltage-gated sodium channels to open. This influx of sodium ions depolarizes the neuron, and causes the voltage-gated potassium channels to close. This in turn hyperpolarizes the neuron, making it less likely that another action potential will be generated. The action potential then travels down the axon as a wave of depolarization. Voltage-gated sodium channels open again, and more Na+ ions flow into the cell. This process continues until all of the voltage-gated sodium channels are closed near the axon terminal. At this point, neurotransmitters are released from vesicles into the synaptic cleft between neurons	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron.
When an action potential is generated at the dendrite of a neuron, it propagates down the axon to the synaptic terminals.

An action potential is a sudden change in the electrical properties of a neuron that allows it to transmit an impulse. This occurs when the threshold potential is reached and Na+ ions flow into the neuron through voltage-gated channels. The influx of Na+ ions causes the membrane potential to reach its peak, which then triggers the opening of calcium channels. Calcium ions then rush into the neuron, causing it to fire an action potential.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron.
An action potential is a change in electrical potential that travels down a neuron. This occurs when the voltage-gated sodium channels open and allow Na+ ions to enter the neuron.

When a frog breathes, it takes in carbon dioxide-rich air and releases oxygen-rich air. The process begins with the frog's lungs expanding as it inhales.

Drugs can also block receptors from being activated by natural substances or competing drugs.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain interaction between drugs and receptor sites.
Drugs interact with receptor sites on cells to produce a specific effect. The drug binds to the receptor site, which then causes a change in the cell that produces the desired therapeutic effect.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain interaction between drugs and receptor sites.
Drugs can interact with receptor sites in a number of ways. They can bind to the site, preventing other molecules from doing so; they can activate the site, causing it to change shape and allow other molecules to bind; or they can block the site, preventing any molecule from binding.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain interaction between drugs and receptor sites.
Receptor sites are the locations on cells where drugs attach and interact with the cell to produce a response. Drugs can bind to receptor sites in two ways: agonist or antagonist.

When light is scattered off of a particle in a medium, the direction of the light can be changed. This type of scattering is called Raleigh scattering.

Indirect means involve the use of second messengers, such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) or calcium ions, which are created as a result of receptor activation. These second messengers then interact with downstream effector molecules to produce the desired response.	biological signal transduction	Explain biological signal transduction.
Biological signal transduction is the process by which a biological signal is converted into an effect on cell function. This can involve changes in gene expression, protein activity or other cellular processes.	biological signal transduction	Explain biological signal transduction.
Biological signal transduction is the process that converts a chemical or physical stimulus into an electrical or biochemical signal. This process allows cells to respond to their environment and relay information between different parts of the cell.	biological signal transduction	Explain biological signal transduction.
In biological signal transduction, a molecule called a ligand binds to a receptor on the surface of a cell. This causes the receptor to change shape, and this change in shape activates an enzyme inside the cell that starts a chain reaction that leads to the production of proteins. These proteins cause the cell to respond in some way, for example by dividing or releasing chemicals.	biological signal transduction	Explain biological signal transduction.
A biological signal is a message that travels between cells in order to coordinate their activities. This communication can involve the exchange of proteins, ions, or other small molecules. The process of transmitting these signals is known as signal transduction.Signal transduction begins when a receptor on the surface of a cell detects a molecule from outside the cell. This molecule may be a hormone, neurotransmitter, or any other type of signaling molecule. The receptor then initiates a chain reaction inside the cell that leads to the desired response.	biological signal transduction	Explain biological signal transduction.
