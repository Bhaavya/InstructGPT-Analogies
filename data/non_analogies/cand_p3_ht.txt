The action potential starts at the dendrite and moves down to the axon.	action potential	Explain action potential in plain language to a second grader.
The action potential is a very important process that happens in our cells. It is what allows us to move and think. The action potential starts with the cell receiving a signal from another cell. This signal causes special channels in the cell membrane to open. When these channels open, sodium ions flow into the cell. This influx of sodium ions makes the inside of the cell more positive than the outside. When the inside of the cell becomes too positive, this sets off a chain reaction that causes all of the channels to close at once. This shuts off the inflow of sodium ions and restores equilibrium within the cell.	action potential	Explain action potential in plain language to a second grader.

Stars are born when gas and dust in space collapse under their own weight. As a star forms, it starts to heat up from the powerful forces at work inside it. The heat makes the gas and dust start to glow, and we see this as a star shining in the sky.Most stars spend most of their lives burning hydrogen into helium in a process called fusion. This is what makes them shine so brightly! Fusion happens when atoms of hydrogen collide together and turn into helium.A star will keep fusing hydrogen into helium until it runs out of fuel. When that happens, the star begins to die. It gets hotter and brighter as it uses up its last bit of energy, until finally it explodes in a supernova!	main-sequence lifetimes of stars	Explain main-sequence lifetimes of stars in plain language to a second grader.
Stars on the main sequence are burning hydrogen in their cores. As they use up hydrogen, they get bigger and brighter. When they have used up all of their hydrogen, they start to use helium, and then other elements. When these stars run out of fuel, they die.	main-sequence lifetimes of stars	Explain main-sequence lifetimes of stars in plain language to a second grader.
A star is born when a large cloud of gas and dust collapses. The center of the cloud becomes very dense and starts to heat up. This makes the gas pressure increase, which pushes the material outwards. The material that is blown away from the center forms a disk around the star. The material in this disk starts to clump together, until it becomes big enough to start fusion reactions. These reactions release energy, which makes the star shine.The amount of time a star spends on the main sequence depends on its mass. A high-mass star will spend less time on the main sequence than a low-mass star will. As a star uses up its fuel, it gradually moves off of the main sequence and becomes either a red giant or supergiant.	main-sequence lifetimes of stars	Explain main-sequence lifetimes of stars in plain language to a second grader.
A star's life can be divided into three parts: the Main Sequence, The Giant Phase and the White Dwarf Phase.The Main Sequence is when a star is using hydrogen to create energy. This lasts for about 10 billion years. The Giant Phase is when a star uses helium to create energy. This lasts for about 1 billion years. The White Dwarf Phase is when a star dies and becomes a small, cool object.	main-sequence lifetimes of stars	Explain main-sequence lifetimes of stars in plain language to a second grader.
Stars spend most of their lives as main-sequence stars. This is because they are burning the hydrogen in their cores. The main-sequence lifetime of a star depends on its mass.

When atoms bond together to form molecules, the electrons in their outer shells can form different kinds of bonds. When these atoms bond together to form a molecule, their electron configurations can be very stable. But sometimes, an atom will lose one of its electrons and another atom will gain one of its electrons. This creates an unstable molecule, and it's easy for this molecule to fall apart and rearrange itself into a more stable configuration.Sometimes, when two or more unstable molecules meet each other, they'll bond together because it's easier for them to become stable that way. These are called resonance hybrids.	resonance hybrid	Explain resonance hybrid in plain language to a second grader.
Resonance hybrid is a model that helps chemists to understand the bonding in molecules. The resonance hybrid is made up of the best Lewis structures for the molecule. In simple terms, it means that all of the electrons are shared equally between all of the atoms in the molecule.	resonance hybrid	Explain resonance hybrid in plain language to a second grader.
When atoms bond together to form molecules, they share electrons in order to have a complete set of eight. Sometimes, an atom will lose or gain an electron so that it has eight again, but other atoms might not have the same number of protons (the positively charged part of an atom). When this happens, the atom with too many or too few electrons can become unstable and might try to find another atom with exactly eight electrons. This process is called resonance because the atom is borrowing or sharing electrons with other atoms until it becomes stable.	resonance hybrid	Explain resonance hybrid in plain language to a second grader.
A resonance hybrid is an atom that has more than one type of electron orbit. This happens when an atom takes in or gives off electrons in a way that creates more than one kind of electron orbit.	resonance hybrid	Explain resonance hybrid in plain language to a second grader.
Resonance hybrid is a way of drawing Lewis structures that shows how electrons are shared in molecules. The lines between atoms represent where the electrons are located.

The process of DNA replication is something that happens inside all living cells. It helps the cell create a copy of its genetic information so that it can divide and create new cells. The process starts when an enzyme called DNA polymerase attaches to the DNA molecule. It then copies the genetic information one strand at a time, creating two identical copies of the DNA molecule.	dna replication	Explain dna replication in plain language to a second grader.
When a cell divides, it makes a copy of its genetic information in the form of DNA. The copying process is called replication. During replication, the two strands of the DNA molecule split apart. An enzyme called DNA polymerase assembles new strands of DNA by matching up the correct nucleotides (the building blocks of DNA).	dna replication	Explain dna replication in plain language to a second grader.
 DNA replication is the process by which a single strand of DNA is copied into two new strands. This happens in the cells of our bodies when we are born and throughout our lives. The new strands are exact copies of the original, and each one contains all the information needed to direct the development and functioning of our cells.	dna replication	Explain dna replication in plain language to a second grader.
Every living thing is made up of tiny cells. Inside each cell are small things called chromosomes. Chromosomes have a lot of genetic information in them, which tells our body how to grow and develop.

Translation is the process of reading a piece of genetic information called a gene and creating a protein molecule out of it. The genetic code is made up of four letters that stand for different molecules: A, G, C, and T. These letters are strung together to form genes, which are like recipes for proteins. During translation, a special enzyme called RNA polymerase reads these letters and creates a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA). This mRNA carries the instructions for making a particular protein from the gene to another part of the cell where ribosomes can read them. Ribosomes are structures in cells that build proteins by stringing together amino acids according to the orders given by mRNA.	protein translation	Explain protein translation in plain language to a second grader.

When an action potential travels down a neuron, it causes tiny molecular machines called ion channels to open. This allows electrically charged particles (ions) to flow into and out of the neuron. The inflow of positive ions makes the inside of the neuron more positive, while the outflow of negative ions makes it more negative. This change in voltage propagates (travels) down the neuron like a wave until it reaches its end. When the action potential arrives at synapses, it triggers electrical signals that communicate with other neurons or muscles cells	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron in plain language to a second grader.
An action potential is a wave of electricity that travels down a neuron. This wave starts at the neuron's cell body and moves down its axon to its terminals. At the terminals, the action potential causes neurotransmitters to be released into the synaptic cleft, where they bind to receptors on the surface of neighboring neurons. This process allows information to be transmitted from one neuron to another	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron in plain language to a second grader.
When something happens that stimulates a neuron (like when you touch something), the neuron sends out an electrical signal called an action potential.

When an electrical signal is sent down a neuron, it causes tiny pores to open that allow electrically charged particles (ions) to flow in. This creates an electrical current that travels down the neuron. The current triggers more pores to open, which allows even more ions to flow in, creating a larger current. This process continues until the message reaches the end of the neuron and is passed on to the next one.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron in plain language to a second grader.
When an action potential is generated in a neuron, it travels down the neuron until it reaches its end.

When light hits a solid object, some of the light is reflected off the surface and some of it goes into the object. If you look at an object from many different angles, you will see that it looks different depending on which angle you are looking at it from. This difference in how an object looks when viewed from different angles is called its "shape." The shape of an object is determined by the way light reflects off its surface.	stokes scattering	Explain stokes scattering in plain language to a second grader.
Light is a type of energy that travels through the air and is used to see things. When light shines on something, it reflects off of it in all directions. Some of the light goes into our eyes and we can see what’s being lit up. Stokes scattering happens when something small gets in the way of the light beam as it’s reflecting off of an object. This causes some of the light to change direction, which makes the object look blurry or fuzzy.	stokes scattering	Explain stokes scattering in plain language to a second grader.
When light shines on an object, some of the light bounces off and some is absorbed. The light that bounces off goes in all directions.

Electricity is what powers our lights and appliances. Electricity flows through wires to light bulbs, motors, and other devices. It's kind of like water flowing through a hose to a sprinkler. Voltage is the pressure that makes electricity flow, like water pressure in a hose. Resistance is how easily electricity flows through something, like how easily water flows through different size hoses. When you turn on a light switch, it opens a circuit that allows electricity to flow from the power company to the light bulb.	electric circuit	Explain electric circuit in plain language to a second grader.
An electric circuit is a path that electricity can flow through. It usually has metal wires that electrons can flow through, making an electrical current. Circuits are used in all sorts of things, from simple lamps to complex machines.	electric circuit	Explain electric circuit in plain language to a second grader.

Water molecules are attracted to each other by hydrogen bonds. The water molecule is polar, with a positive end and a negative end. The side of the water molecule with the negative end is attracted to the side of another water molecule with a negative end. This creates clusters of water molecules called hydration shells. The oxygen atom in the middle of the water molecule is slightly negatively charged and attracts positively charged ions such as sodium and potassium. These ions are also surrounded by hydration shells. Hydrophobic substances do not have these charges and so they are not attracted to the water molecules. Instead, they push them away, creating pockets of empty space around them.	hydrophobic effect	Explain hydrophobic effect in plain language to a second grader.
Water is attracted to other water molecules, which is why it forms droplets. The hydrophobic effect happens when non-polar molecules (molecules that don't like water) are mixed in with the water. These molecules are repelled by the water and form their own clumps or clusters away from the water.	hydrophobic effect	Explain hydrophobic effect in plain language to a second grader.
Water molecules are attracted to each other by forces called hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen bond between two water molecules is weak, but it's strong enough that a lot of them can stick together. This makes water very sticky and thick. Hydrophobic (meaning "water-fearing") molecules are not attracted to water and they want to stay away from it. So when you put a hydrophobic molecule in water, the water pushes all of the other water away from it, creating a small bubble around the molecule.	hydrophobic effect	Explain hydrophobic effect in plain language to a second grader.
Water is a molecule made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. The oxygen atom in water has a negative charge and the hydrogen atoms have positive charges. When water molecules are close to each other, the negatively charged oxygen atom pulls the positively charged hydrogen atoms closer together. This makes it difficult for other substances to get close to the water molecules because they are repelled by the strong electrical forces between them. Substances that are not attracted to water are said to be hydrophobic (water fearing).	hydrophobic effect	Explain hydrophobic effect in plain language to a second grader.
The hydrophobic effect is the force that makes water molecules stick together and push other things away.	hydrophobic effect	Explain hydrophobic effect in plain language to a second grader.
Biological signal transduction is the process by which a signal (like a hormone) is transmitted from one part of the body to another. This happens when special proteins in the cells called receptors detect the signal and start a chain reaction that eventually leads to changes in the cell's behavior.	biological signal transduction	Explain biological signal transduction in plain language to a second grader.
A signal is a message that tells your body what to do. When you see something, hear something, or smell something, it sends a signal to your brain telling it what to do. This happens because your eyes, ears, and nose send messages to your brain using special chemicals called neurotransmitters. These signals are then turned into electrical signals that travel along nerves to the part of the brain that controls movement, hearing, or smelling.	biological signal transduction	Explain biological signal transduction in plain language to a second grader.
Biological signal transduction is when a biological signal (like a hormone) is transmitted from one place in the body to another. This happens when the hormone binds to a receptor on the surface of a cell, and then that message is passed into the cell's interior.	biological signal transduction	Explain biological signal transduction in plain language to a second grader.
Biological signal transduction is the process by which a signal from one molecule is converted into a response in another molecule. This can happen when a hormone binds to a receptor on the surface of a cell, for example. The hormone causes the receptor to change shape, and this change allows other molecules inside the cell to bind to the receptor. These molecules then start a chain reaction that leads to changes in the way the cell behaves.	biological signal transduction	Explain biological signal transduction in plain language to a second grader.
When a hormone or neurotransmitter binds to its receptor on the surface of a cell, it starts a chain reaction that ends with the opening of ion channels. This allows ions to flow into or out of the cell, changing its electrical state. This change in voltage can then trigger other cellular processes, such as releasing neurotransmitters or enzymes.	biological signal transduction	Explain biological signal transduction in plain language to a second grader.
