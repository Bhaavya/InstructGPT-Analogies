The human active memory system is analogous to a computer in that they are both able to store and recall information.	human active memory system	How is human active memory system analogous to computer?
Computer memory is a series of storage locations where data and programs are kept while they are being used. Active computer memory, or working memory, is the small amount of memory that is currently in use. When you open a document on your computer, it is loaded into active memory so that you can work on it. As you make changes to the document, it is constantly rewritten back to active memory. If you close the document without saving your changes, the original copy from permanent storage will be replaced with the latest version that was in active memory.Human beings have a similar type of active memory system. Our brains store information in short-term memories called buffers while we are using it. The buffer can hold only a limited amount of information at any given time, so older information is continually replaced with new information as we learn and remember things. Like computer documents, human memories can be overwritten if something else takes their place in our Buffer space	human active memory system	How is human active memory system analogous to computer?
Computer systems are designed to store and process information. The analogy between human active memory system and computer can be drawn on the basis of following features:1. Both human active memory system and computer use some form of storage to retain information. In case of computer, this is usually in the form of electronic circuits, while in humans it is typically in the brain in the form of neurons.2. Both human active memory system and computer use a processor to access stored information and carry out logical operations on it. For humans, this processing takes place in the brain, while for computers it occurs through software running on a microprocessor or central processing unit (CPU). 3. Both human active memory system and computer can output information as well as receive input from other sources. In humans, sensory organs provide input into the brain, while for computers various forms of input/output (I/O) devices are used such as keyboards, mice etc.	human active memory system	How is human active memory system analogous to computer?

The rate-determining step of a reaction is analogous to buying stamps at the post office, when there is a long line of customers. The analogy can be explained as follows: imagine that you are in charge of buying stamps for the entire post office. To get the job done as quickly as possible, you would want to purchase the stamps from the vendor who has the shortest line. This is analogous to the rate-determining step of a reaction; it is the step that determines how quickly the reaction will proceed.	rate-determining step of a reaction	How is rate-determining step of a reaction analogous to buying stamps at the post office, when there is a long line of customers?

One way to think about the rate-determining step of a reaction is to imagine that you are standing in line at the post office, and each customer is trying to buy stamps. The rate-determining step is like the point at which the next customer steps up to the counter. If there are a lot of customers in line, it will take longer for the next customer to get served, and vice versa.	rate-determining step of a reaction	How is rate-determining step of a reaction analogous to buying stamps at the post office, when there is a long line of customers?

These signals are converted into digital information, which is used to create a duplicate of the original document. Dna replication works in a similar way. The dna molecule is like the document, and the proteins responsible for replication are like the photocopier machine. When ultraviolet light hits the dna molecule, it causes thymine dimers to form. These dimers can be thought of as errors or black spots on the document.

This process is similar to how a balloon fills with air when you blow into it and deflates when you let go of the balloon.	breathing mechanism of frogs	How is breathing mechanism of frogs analogous to blowing of the balloon?
The balloon analogy is appropriate because when you blow into a balloon, the air inside the balloon expands. This causes the elastic material of the balloon to stretch. The frog's lungs work in a similar way. When it breathes in, its ribcage expands and pulls on the lungs. This causes them to inflate and fill with air.	breathing mechanism of frogs	How is breathing mechanism of frogs analogous to blowing of the balloon?
Layered architecture is analogous to communication with translators in that it provides a way for different parts of a system to communicate with each other without having to understand the entire system. By using layers, each part can communicate with the layer directly above or below it, while ignoring all other layers. This allows different parts of the system to be developed and updated independently, and prevents them from having to constantly change each other's code.	layered architecture	How is layered architecture analogous to communication with translators?
If a business wants to communicate with people in other parts of the world, it might use a translator to help convert its words into another language. In a similar way, layered architecture helps different parts of an application communicate with each other. The layer closest to the user (such as the presentation layer) converts information into a format that can be understood by the next lowest layer (such as the business logic layer), and so on. This allows developers to create applications using smaller pieces that can be easily reused and modified.	layered architecture	How is layered architecture analogous to communication with translators?
Just as communication with translators allows for people who speak different languages to effectively communicate with one another, layered architecture allows different parts of a software system to communicate effectively with one another. The use of layers in architecture provides a way for the various parts of a system to be organized and separated, making it easier for them to work together. Each layer can act as a translator between the layers above and below it, allowing information to be passed smoothly between them.	layered architecture	How is layered architecture analogous to communication with translators?
Just as a translator is necessary to communicate with people who speak different languages, a layered architecture is necessary to communicate with computers that use different architectures.	layered architecture	How is layered architecture analogous to communication with translators?

A limiting reactant is analogous to chocolate distribution because it is the component in a reaction that is used up first. The excess reactant is like the extra chocolate bars that are left over after everyone has taken their share.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	How is limiting reactant and excess reactant analogous to chocolate distribution?
A chocolate bar is distributed in a way where there are many small pieces and a few large pieces. This is analogous to limiting reactant and excess reactant because the smaller pieces represent the limiting reactant while the larger pieces represent the excess reactant.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	How is limiting reactant and excess reactant analogous to chocolate distribution?
A limiting reactant is like a chocolate bar that is being shared between a number of people. The more people there are, the less each person gets. An excess reactant is like a chocolate bar that has been left out and is freely available to all.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	How is limiting reactant and excess reactant analogous to chocolate distribution?
Chocolate distribution is analogous to limiting reactant and excess reactant because it is a way of describing how resources are distributed. In both cases, there is a limited amount of something that is being shared among people or entities. With chocolate distribution, the analogy would be that each person gets an equal share of the chocolate. This would be equivalent to a situation where there is only one limiting reactant and everyone gets their fair share. If there were multiple limiting reagents, then the analogy would be more like distributing candy bars: some people might get two candy bars while others might only get one.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	How is limiting reactant and excess reactant analogous to chocolate distribution?
Limiting reactant is analogous to chocolate distribution because when there is a limiting reactant, the reaction will stop once that reactant is gone. This means that not all of the chocolate will be used and some will remain in its original form. Excess reactant is also analogous to chocolate distribution because when there is an excess of a reactant, the reaction will continue until all of the extra material has been used up. This means that more chocolate than necessary will be used and less chocolate will remain in its original form.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	How is limiting reactant and excess reactant analogous to chocolate distribution?

Just like an office has workers who perform different tasks, a eukaryotic cell has organelles that carry out specific functions.	eukaryotic cell	How is eukaryotic cell analogous to working office?
In eukaryotic cells, the cytoplasm is partitioned into membrane-bound organelles. These organelles carry out specific functions in the cell: The nucleus contains the genetic information, ribosomes are responsible for protein synthesis, and mitochondria produce energy.

Prokaryotic cells are similar to self-started businesses in that they both have a limited amount of resources available to them. In the case of prokaryotes, these resources include DNA, ribosomes, and various enzymes. Prokaryotic cells must also be able to adapt quickly in order to survive in their environment. Like self-started businesses, prokaryotes must be resourceful and efficient in order to thrive.	prokaryotic cell	How is prokaryotic cell analogous to self started business?
A prokaryotic cell is a self-sufficient, autonomous unit much like a small business. It has all the necessary components to survive and grow without help from other cells.

The kernel is the heart of an operating system, analogous to a college library's collection of books. The kernel provides basic services for all other parts of the operating system, analogous to the librarians who manage and organize the books in a library. Just as different sections of a library are specialized (e.g., biochemistry, history), so too are different parts of an operating system's kernel (e.g., process management, file systems).	operating systems kernel	How is operating systems kernel analogous to college library?
The operating system kernel is analogous to the college library because it stores all of the information that the computer needs to run. The kernel manages memory, processes, and files, just like a librarian manages books in a library.	operating systems kernel	How is operating systems kernel analogous to college library?
The library analogy is a good one because it highlights the importance of the kernel in an operating system. Just as a library needs to have a well-organized and functional collection of books in order to be useful, an operating system needs a well-designed kernel in order to function properly. The kernel provides basic services that all other applications rely on, such as memory management and process scheduling. Without a good kernel, an operating system would not be able to do anything useful.	operating systems kernel	How is operating systems kernel analogous to college library?
If you were to dissolve a certain number of coffee granules in water, you would reach a point where no more coffee granules would dissolve no matter how much stirring you did. This is analogous to a limiting reactant because at a certain point, the reaction will stop happening because there are not enough of one of the chemicals involved to create any more product.	limiting reactant	How is limiting reactant analogous to a cup of coffee granules?

In an engine, the limiting reactant is the one that limits how much product can be formed.	limiting reactant	How is limiting reactant analogous to engine?
A helicase is an enzyme that "unzips" DNA by breaking the hydrogen bonds between the base pairs. This is analogous to how a zipper zip works - it breaks the hydrogen bonds between the two pieces of fabric, causing them to come together.	helicase	How is helicase analogous to zipper zip?
A zipper is a clothing item with a series of small, interconnected metal or plastic teeth along one edge. When the two edges are brought together, the teeth interlock and the fabric is secured. Helixes are also made up of small, interconnected pieces that work together to perform a function. In both cases, if one piece is missing or damaged, the whole system falls apart.	helicase	How is helicase analogous to zipper zip?
Both helicase and zipper zip use energy to create a movement. In the case of a zipper, the energy is used to move two pieces of fabric together. With helicase, the energy is used to break down hydrogen bonds in DNA so that replication can occur.	helicase	How is helicase analogous to zipper zip?

The way that drugs interact with receptor sites is analogous to the way that a foot fits in a footprint. The drugs are like the feet, and the receptor sites are like the impressions in the ground. The drug molecules fit into the receptor sites snugly, just as a foot fits perfectly into its corresponding impression in the ground. This analogy helps to illustrate how drugs can bind tightly to their receptors and produce specific effects.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	How is interaction between drugs and receptor sites analogous to foot fitting in footprint?
The interaction between drugs and receptor sites is analogous to foot fitting in footprint because when a drug attaches to a receptor site, it conforms to the shape of that site much like a foot fits into the impression made by a shoe. This analogy helps us to understand how drugs can interact with specific receptors to produce specific effects.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	How is interaction between drugs and receptor sites analogous to foot fitting in footprint?
If you think of a receptor site as a footprint, then the drug is the foot. The more accurately the foot fits in the print, the better it will function. Likewise, if a drug fits perfectly into its corresponding receptor site, it will be able to interact with that receptor and produce an effect.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	How is interaction between drugs and receptor sites analogous to foot fitting in footprint?
When a person's foot is placed in a footprint, the outline of the foot corresponds to the receptor sites on the brain. The drugs fit into these receptors like the foot fits into the footprint, creating an interaction between them.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	How is interaction between drugs and receptor sites analogous to foot fitting in footprint?
Interaction between receptors and drugs can be thought of as foot fitting in footprint analogy. Just like a foot needs to fit perfectly in a footprint for the person to be stable, a drug needs to bind perfectly with its receptor site for the desired effect to happen. If there is too much or too little space between the foot and the print, stability is lost and so is the ability for the person to walk properly. In addition, if there are foreign objects (e.g., pebbles) interfering with the foot-print interaction, it becomes even more difficult for the individual to move around effectively. Analogously, if there are other molecules present that compete with or block binding of the drug molecule to its receptor site, then less effective treatment will occur.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	How is interaction between drugs and receptor sites analogous to foot fitting in footprint?

This is similar to how glycolysis works because it starts out slowly by using only one glucose molecule, but then it quickly uses up all of the glucose molecules and ends with a slow stop.	glycolysis	How is glycolysis analogous to roller coaster?
Glycolysis is analogous to a roller coaster in that both processes are powered by energy. In the case of glycolysis, this energy comes from the breakdown of glucose molecules. With a roller coaster, this energy comes from potential and kinetic energy as the ride moves along its track.	glycolysis	How is glycolysis analogous to roller coaster?
A roller coaster is a thrill ride that takes passengers up and down hills, curves, and loops. It relies on the energy of gravity to move the cars along the track. The same is true for glycolysis – it uses the energy of glucose (gravity) to convert it into two molecules of pyruvate.	glycolysis	How is glycolysis analogous to roller coaster?
When a roller coaster moves up a track, it potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. When it goes over the top of the hill and down the other side, that kinetic energy is converted back into potential energy. This happens again and again as the roller coaster moves along its track. In glycolysis, glucose is moved from one compartment to another in cells. The movement of glucose creates a type of potential energy called Gibbs free energy. Glucose is moved from an area where there is less Gibbs free energy to an area where there is more Gibbs free energy. This process happens repeatedly as glycolysis proceeds	glycolysis	How is glycolysis analogous to roller coaster?
In anti-stokes scattering, a particle is scattered by another particle in the opposite direction as the original. For example, if a ball is thrown at a plate and bounces off, the reverse happens with anti-stokes scattering. The ball would be scattered away from the plate instead of towards it.	anti-stokes scattering	How is anti-stokes scattering analogous to ball striking a plate?
When a ball is hit against a plate, it creates ripples that spread outward. These ripples are analogous to the light waves scattered by an object in anti-Stokes scattering.	anti-stokes scattering	How is anti-stokes scattering analogous to ball striking a plate?
Ball striking a plate is analogous to anti-stokes scattering because it is both an interaction between two objects. In ball striking a plate, the ball hits the plate and bounces off. This interaction creates forces that cause the ball to move in a new direction. In anti-stokes scattering, light hits an object and scatters in all directions. This interaction also creates forces that cause light to move in new directions.	anti-stokes scattering	How is anti-stokes scattering analogous to ball striking a plate?
Anti-stokes scattering is analogous to ball striking a plate in that they are both examples of elastic collisions. In anti-stokes scattering, photons collide with another atom and recoil in the opposite direction. This interaction is similar to a ball bouncing off of a plate, where the ball rebounds in the opposite direction from which it was struck.	anti-stokes scattering	How is anti-stokes scattering analogous to ball striking a plate?
When a ball is struck by a bat, it causes the air around it to vibrate. This vibration creates a pressure wave that travels outward from the ball. The wave can be thought of as similar to ripples on the surface of water. Just like waves in water, sound waves will reflect off of boundaries they encounter. When a sound wave reflects off of an object, it changes its direction. This change in direction is called scattering.Anti-stokes scattering is very similar to regular scattering, except that it occurs when a sound wave reflects off of an object in the opposite direction than it was traveling. For example, if a sound wave is traveling towards a wall and reflecting back away from the wall, then this would be an example of anti-stokes scattering.	anti-stokes scattering	How is anti-stokes scattering analogous to ball striking a plate?
In both cases, a force is applied to a surface. In stokes scattering, the force is from a light beam hitting a particle and in ball striking a plate, the force is from a ball hitting a plate.	stokes scattering	How is stokes scattering analogous to ball striking a plate?
In stokes scattering, a light source emits light waves into a medium. Some of the waves pass through the medium while others are scattered by objects in the medium. In ball striking a plate, a ball is projected at a surface and some of the energy from the ball is transferred to the object it hits while some is lost to other directions.	stokes scattering	How is stokes scattering analogous to ball striking a plate?
In both cases, energy is transferred from one object to another. With stokes scattering, a photon transfers its energy to a electron, which then radiates away the energy as a new photon. With ball striking a plate, the ball's kinetic energy is transferred to the plate, causing it to vibrate.	stokes scattering	How is stokes scattering analogous to ball striking a plate?
When a ball is hit against a plate, it scatters in all directions. This is similar to the way light scatters when it hits particles in the atmosphere.	stokes scattering	How is stokes scattering analogous to ball striking a plate?
When a ball is thrown at a plate, the ball scatters off of the plate in all directions. This is similar to what happens when light hits an object. The light scatters off of the object in all directions.	stokes scattering	How is stokes scattering analogous to ball striking a plate?

In this case, the quantity is the amount of a substance that is necessary to kill 50% of the population within a given time frame.	median lethal dose	How is median lethal dose analogous to balls and target?
The median lethal dose is analogous to balls and target because it is the dose of a substance that is expected to kill half of the people who are exposed to it.	median lethal dose	How is median lethal dose analogous to balls and target?
In both cases, there is a central target surrounded by smaller objects. In the case of balls and target, the small objects are balls and the central object is the target. In the case of median lethal dose, the small objects are molecules and the central object is a living being.	median lethal dose	How is median lethal dose analogous to balls and target?

A balloon is inflated with a gas, such as helium, hydrogen, or air. As the balloon expands, the surface becomes less curved and more stretched out. In the same way, the universe is expanding and becoming less curved.	universe	How is universe analogous to surface of a balloon?
The universe is analogous to the surface of a balloon because it is expanding. The surface of a balloon expands as the air inside it inflates. Similarly, the universe is expanding as more and more matter is created.	universe	How is universe analogous to surface of a balloon?
A balloon is a good analogy for the universe because, like a balloon, the universe has an outer surface and an inner volume. The outer surface of a balloon is called the skin; it's where you can see the wrinkles and folds in the rubber. The inner volume of a balloon is filled with air; it's what you blow up to make the balloon bigger.Just as you can blow up a balloon to different sizes, so too can astronomers inflate our model of the universe by making different assumptions about its beginning, end, and overall shape. For example, if we assume that inflation stopped at some point early in cosmic history, then we get a universe that looks like a big inflated ball. If instead we assume that inflation continued forever (à la Alan Guth), then we get something more like a infinite plane or sheet.	universe	How is universe analogous to surface of a balloon?

Chemical equilibrium is analogous to water level in dam and lake because both the chemical equilibrium and water level depend on how much material is inputted or taken out of the system. With too much inflow, the water level rises, and with too much outflow, the water level falls. In a similar way, if more reactants are introduced into a chemical reaction than products are removed, then the concentration of reactants will increase until an equilibrium is reached where the rate of production equals the rate of consumption.	chemical equilibrium	How is chemical equilibrium analogous to water level in dam and lake?

One way to think of chemical equilibrium is that it is analogous to the water level in a dam and lake. The water level in a dam and lake can be thought of as being in equilibrium because the amount of water flowing into the reservoir (the dam) is equal to the amount of water flowing out of the reservoir. In a similar way, chemical equilibrium occurs when the rate at which molecules are entering and leaving a system are equal.	chemical equilibrium	How is chemical equilibrium analogous to water level in dam and lake?
Chemical equilibrium is analogous to water level in dam and lake because both are systems that are trying to reach a state of equilibrium. In the case of the water level in dam and lake, it is seeking a balance between the amount of water coming into the system and the amount of water leaving the system. This same concept applies to chemical equilibrium, where there is a balance between the reactants and products of a reaction.	chemical equilibrium	How is chemical equilibrium analogous to water level in dam and lake?
Water level in a dam and lake is analogous to chemical equilibrium because they are both systems that are trying to reach equilibrium. The water level in a dam is affected by the amount of water flowing into it and the amount of water flowing out of it. The water level in a lake is also affected by the amount of water flowing into it and the amount of water flowing out of it, but it is also affected by evaporation. Chemical equilibrium is similar because there are things entering and leaving the system that affect how equilibrium is reached.	chemical equilibrium	How is chemical equilibrium analogous to water level in dam and lake?

Cats, mice and cake are all analogous to ohm's law because they are all related in some way. Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor is proportional to the voltage across it. This analogy can be used to explain how different things are related. For example, cats and mice can be related by saying that a cat is like a high voltage while a mouse is like a low voltage. Cake can be related to this analogy by saying that cake is like an object with a lot of resistance.	ohm's law	How is ohm's law analogous to cats, mice and cake?
Ohm's law is analogous to cats, mice and cake in that it is a fundamental law of physics. Just as there are many different types of cats, mice and cakes, there are many different types of ohm's laws depending on the material properties and geometry involved. However, all cats, mice and cakes obey the same underlying laws of physics. Similarly, all ohm's laws obey Ohm's law.	ohm's law	How is ohm's law analogous to cats, mice and cake?
ohm's law is analogous to cats, mice and cake in that it is a fundamental law of physics. just as there are predictable patterns in the behavior of cats and mice, there are predictable patterns in the flow of electricity through a circuit. and just as you can predict how much cake will be eaten at a party by understanding how people behave, you can understand electrical circuits by understanding ohm's law.	ohm's law	How is ohm's law analogous to cats, mice and cake?
Analogies can be helpful tools for understanding difficult concepts. In this analogy, ohm's law is like a cat. Cats are independent creatures that aren't necessarily influenced by what goes on around them. Ohm's law states that an electric current is directly proportional to the voltage applied to it. This means that the greater the voltage, the greater the electric current will be. Just as cats are unaffected by most things going on around them, ohm's law doesn't change based on what else is happening in a circuit.Mice, on the other hand, are much more influenced by their environment than cats are. If there is noise and activity going on around them, they'll be affected by it and react accordingly. In a similar way, if something changes in a circuit while electricity is flowing through it (like adding or removing resistance), then the current will change too.Lastly, cake is something that everyone enjoys! It's sweet and sugary with lots of calories - just like electricity! People love eating cake because it makes them feel good. Electricity also has positive effects; it powers our devices and keeps us connected to the world around us.	ohm's law	How is ohm's law analogous to cats, mice and cake?
