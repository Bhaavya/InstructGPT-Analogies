In an electric circuit, the electrons flow through a metal wire like air flowing through a tube. The pressure of the air in the tube is pushing the air out of the way as it flows. In a similar way, the voltage (pressure) in an electric circuit is pushing the electrons through the wire.	electric circuit	How is electric circuit like air flowing through a tube?
Electric current is like a flow of water through a pipe. Just as the water can flow freely if there are no obstructions in the pipe, electric current flows freely through metal wires. If you block the water flow by inserting a plug into the pipe, the pressure behind the plug will increase until it overcomes the resistance of the plug and bursts it free. In a similar way, an electric current will try to flow through any obstruction in its path, such as a resistor. The greater the resistance, the higher the voltage needed to push enough current through to make sparks fly.	electric circuit	How is electric circuit like rope through metal rings?
Electric current is like a flow of electrons through a metal wire, just as water flows through a pipe. In both cases, the fluid (electrons or water) follows the path of least resistance. If you put metal rings on either end of a piece of rope, and insert an electric current into the rope, the electrons will flow through the metal rings and bypass the rope.	electric circuit	How is electric circuit like rope through metal rings?
Electricity is like a flow of water through a pipe. The metal rings are the pipes and the electricity flows through them just like water does.	electric circuit	How is electric circuit like rope through metal rings?
An electric circuit is like a rope through metal rings in that it provides a path for electricity to flow. The ropes are the wires, and the metal rings are the electrical connectors called terminals. When you plug something into an outlet, your body completes the circuit by providing a path for the electricity to flow from the outlet to the device plugged in.	electric circuit	How is electric circuit like rope through metal rings?
Electricity is like a current of water through a series of metal rings. Just as the flow of water can be controlled by shutting off certain valves, electricity can be controlled with switches.	electric circuit	How is electric circuit like rope through metal rings?
The hydrophobic effect can be like teenagers at a party in that it is attracted to other hydrophobic substances and repelled by water.	hydrophobic effect	How is hydrophobic effect like teenagers at a party?
The hydrophobic effect is like teenagers at a party in that they both tend to congregate together. The hydrophobic molecules (like the teenagers) will group together and avoid contact with the water (the party).	hydrophobic effect	How is hydrophobic effect like teenagers at a party?
The hydrophobic effect is like teenagers at a party in that they are both attracted to each other. The hydrophobic effect is the tendency of molecules to be repelled from water, while the teenagers are attracted to each other.	hydrophobic effect	How is hydrophobic effect like teenagers at a party?
Hydrophobic effect is like teenagers at a party in that they are both attracted to each other. Hydrophobic molecules are drawn to each other and form clusters, while water molecules are repelled. This creates an imbalance of charge that causes the water to be pushed away from the hydrophobic molecules.	hydrophobic effect	How is hydrophobic effect like teenagers at a party?
The hydrophobic effect is like teenagers at a party in that it is attracted to other things that are also not water. In the case of the party, it would be teens who are drawn to each other because they share common interests. With respect to water and oil, the molecules are attracted to each other because they share similar properties (they are both nonpolar).	hydrophobic effect	How is hydrophobic effect like teenagers at a party?
In both cases, a signal is transmitted from one entity to another, and the recipient responds accordingly. In biological signal transduction, this might mean secreting a hormone in response to a certain stimulus; in threat communication, it might mean fleeing or attacking in response to an perceived danger.	biological signal transduction	How is biological signal transduction like threat communication in animals?
In both cases, a signal is transmitted from one entity to another, triggering a response. In biological signal transduction, the signal is usually a hormone or enzyme that travels between cells; in threat communication, the signal is typically a loud noise or visual cue that warns an animal of danger.	biological signal transduction	How is biological signal transduction like threat communication in animals?
In both cases, a signal is sent from one entity to another, and the receiving entity responds in some way. In biological signal transduction, the signal can be a hormone or other molecule that travels between cells; in threat communication, the signal can be an auditory cue or visual sign that warns of danger.	biological signal transduction	How is biological signal transduction like threat communication in animals?
In both cases, a signal is sent from one entity to another, and the recipient interprets that signal in order to produce a response.	biological signal transduction	How is biological signal transduction like threat communication in animals?
In both cases, a signal is transmitted from one entity to another, with the goal of eliciting an appropriate response. In biological signal transduction, this transmission typically occurs within or between cells, while in threat communication it takes place between animals. In both cases, the signals can be simple or complex and can involve many different molecules. Finally, in both systems the responses can be very diverse and range from changes in behavior to alterations in physiology.	biological signal transduction	How is biological signal transduction like threat communication in animals?
