When a ball is struck by a bat, the ball is compressed and then rebounds. This compression and rebound is what creates the ball's motion. Anti-stokes scattering is similar because it is the compression and rebound of light that creates the scattering.	anti-stokes scattering	Explain how anti-stokes scattering is analogous to ball striking a plate.
When a ball is thrown at a plate, the ball scatters off the plate in all directions. This is similar to how light scatters off of particles in the atmosphere.	stokes scattering	Explain how stokes scattering is analogous to ball striking a plate.
The median lethal dose (LD50) is the dose of a substance that kills 50% of the test population. It can be thought of as the number of balls needed to hit the target. If you have a large number of balls, you are more likely to hit the target than if you have a small number of balls. The same is true for the LD50. A small number of animals will die at a low dose, while a large number of animals will die at a high dose.	median lethal dose	Explain how median lethal dose is analogous to balls and target.
The universe is analogous to the surface of a balloon in that it is expanding. The surface of a balloon expands when you blow air into it. The universe expands when it receives more energy.	universe	Explain how universe is analogous to surface of a balloon.
The enzyme mechanism is analogous to lock and key because the enzyme is the lock and the substrate is the key. The enzyme will only bind to the substrate if the shapes of the two molecules are complementary.	enzyme mechanism	Explain how enzyme mechanism is analogous to lock and key.
The goal of anova is to find the signal in the noise. The signal is the effect that you are interested in, and the noise is the variability in the data that is not due to the effect. By using anova, you can identify the signal and determine how much of the variability is due to the effect.	anova	Explain how anova is analogous to finding signal in the noise.
A thermostat is a device that regulates the temperature of a room by turning on or off the furnace or air conditioner. The hypothalamus is a small, almond-sized structure in the brain that controls the body's internal temperature, among other things. It is analogous to a thermostat because it regulates the body's temperature.	thermostat	Explain how thermostat is analogous to hypothalamus.
Chemical equilibrium is analogous to water level in dam and lake because when the water level is high in the dam, the water level in the lake is high, and when the water level is low in the dam, the water level in the lake is low.	chemical equilibrium	Explain how chemical equilibrium is analogous to water level in dam and lake.
Just-in-time is analogous to water and rocks because it is a process that is constantly flowing and changing. Just-in-time is like water because it is always moving and changing, and it is like rocks because it is strong and durable.	just-in-time	Explain how just-in-time is analogous to water and rocks.
Adaptive immunity can be thought of as analogous to police headquarters because it is the central location where all the information about the immune system is collected and processed.

Electric current is analogous to air flowing through a tube. Just as the air pressure in the tube determines how fast the air flows, the voltage in the electric circuit determines how fast the electric current flows. The resistance of the tube (measured in ohms) determines how much pressure is needed to get the air flowing. The same is true for electric circuits - the resistance of the circuit (measured in ohms) determines how much voltage is needed to get the electric current flowing.	electric circuit	Explain how electric circuit is analogous to air flowing through a tube.
Electricity is like a flow of water through a hose. The hose is like a wire, and the water is like electricity. The metal rings are like the electrical contacts at the ends of the wire.
