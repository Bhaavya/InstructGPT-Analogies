Electricity is analogous to air flowing through a tube because they are both fluids that can flow.	electric circuit	How is electric circuit analogous to air flowing through a tube?
Electricity is analogous to a rope through metal rings in that it is a way to transfer energy. In the case of the electric circuit, the energy is in the form of electricity. In the case of the rope, the energy is in the form of potential energy as the rope is stretched.	electric circuit	How is electric circuit analogous to rope through metal rings?
The hydrophobic effect is analogous to teenagers at a party in that they are both attracted to each other. The hydrophobic effect is the attraction between molecules that are not water soluble. This is similar to teenagers at a party, who are attracted to each other because they are not part of the same group.	hydrophobic effect	How is hydrophobic effect analogous to teenagers at a party?
In both cases, a signal is transmitted from one entity to another, with the goal of eliciting a specific response. In the case of biological signal transduction, the signal is a hormone or other molecule that conveys information about the internal state of the organism. In the case of threat communication, the signal is a warning call or other behavior that conveys information about the presence of a predator or other threat. In both cases, the recipient of the signal needs to be able to interpret the signal correctly in order to respond appropriately.	biological signal transduction	How is biological signal transduction analogous to threat communication in animals?
