When a ball is struck by a bat, the ball and bat exchange energy. This energy exchange causes the ball to move faster and the bat to move slower. This is similar to anti-stokes scattering. In anti-stokes scattering, energy is exchanged between the light and the medium. This energy exchange causes the light to move faster and the medium to move slower.	anti-stokes scattering	Explain how anti-stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate.
Stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate in that both involve the transfer of energy. In stokes scattering, the energy is transferred from the light to the particles in the medium. In ball striking a plate, the energy is transferred from the ball to the plate.	stokes scattering	Explain how stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate.
The median lethal dose (LD50) is the dose of a substance that is expected to kill half of the members of a tested population after a certain amount of time. It can be thought of as the "target" that a substance is trying to achieve. Just as a person tries to hit the bullseye on a target, a substance tries to achieve the LD50.	median lethal dose	Explain how median lethal dose is similar to balls and target.
The universe is similar to the surface of a balloon in that it is expanding. The universe is also similar to the surface of a balloon in that it is curved.	universe	Explain how universe is similar to surface of a balloon.
The enzyme mechanism is similar to lock and key in that the enzyme is specific to the substrate it binds to. The enzyme has a specific shape that allows it to bind to the substrate. The lock and key analogy is also appropriate because the enzyme and substrate are like a key and lock, they fit together perfectly.	enzyme mechanism	Explain how enzyme mechanism is similar to lock and key.
Both anova and finding signal in the noise are ways of identifying patterns in data. Anova is a statistical technique that can be used to identify differences between groups of data, while finding signal in the noise is a technique for identifying patterns in data that may be obscured by noise.	anova	Explain how anova is similar to finding signal in the noise.
The hypothalamus is a small, but important, part of the brain that controls body temperature, hunger, and thirst. It does this by releasing hormones that control the body's functions. The hypothalamus is similar to a thermostat because it controls the body's temperature.	thermostat	Explain how thermostat is similar to hypothalamus.
Chemical equilibrium is similar to water level in dam and lake because they are both examples of a system in equilibrium. In both cases, the system is in a state of balance where the input and output of energy is equal.	chemical equilibrium	Explain how chemical equilibrium is similar to water level in dam and lake.
Just-in-time is similar to water and rocks because it is a natural resource that is used to help things run smoothly.	just-in-time	Explain how just-in-time is similar to water and rocks.
Adaptive immunity is similar to police headquarters in that they are both responsible for overseeing and coordinating the activities of their respective organizations. In the case of adaptive immunity, this involves ensuring that the various cells and organs of the immune system are working together to protect the body from infection. Police headquarters is responsible for ensuring that all police officers are aware of their duties and are carrying out their investigations effectively.	adaptive immunity	Explain how adaptive immunity is similar to police headquerters.
Ohm's law is similar to cats, mice and cake because they are all related to electricity. Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage across the conductor. This is similar to how a cat is related to a mouse. A cat will always be attracted to a mouse and will always try to catch it. The voltage is the cat and the current is the mouse. Ohm's law is also similar to cake because they are both related to food. Cake is made up of sugar, flour, eggs and butter. These are all ingredients that are used to make a cake. Ohm's law is made up of three equations: V = IR, I = V/R and R = V/I. These equations are all related to electricity.	ohm's law	Explain how ohm's law is similar to cats, mice and cake.
Transcription is similar to photocopying in that they are both processes that copy information. With transcription, the information is copied from the DNA to the RNA. With photocopying, the information is copied from the original document to a copy of the document.	transcription	Explain how transcription is similar to photocopying.
Both rna polymerase and a xerox machine use a template to create a copy of a document.	rna polymerase	Explain how rna polymerase is similar to xerox machine.
A ribosome is a small, round, particle found in all cells. It is similar to a cook because it is responsible for creating proteins in the cell.	ribosome	Explain how ribosome is similar to cook.
Activator protein is similar to bookmarks because they are both used to help find a specific location in a document.	activator protein	Explain how activator protein is similar to bookmarks.
Electric current is similar to air flowing through a tube in that both involve the movement of a fluid. In the case of electric current, the fluid is electrons, and in the case of air flow, the fluid is air molecules. Just as air flow can be restricted by narrowing the diameter of the tube, electric current can be restricted by narrowing the diameter of the wire. Just as air flow can be increased by widening the diameter of the tube, electric current can be increased by widening the diameter of the wire.	electric circuit	Explain how electric circuit is similar to air flowing through a tube.
Electricity is like a flow of water through a hose. The metal rings are like the water pipe and the rope is like the water.	electric circuit	Explain how electric circuit is similar to rope through metal rings.
Just like how teenagers at a party tend to stick together and avoid getting too close to the water, hydrophobic molecules stick together and avoid getting too close to water. This is because water is a polar molecule and hydrophobic molecules are nonpolar.	hydrophobic effect	Explain how hydrophobic effect is similar to teenagers at a party.
Biological signal transduction is similar to threat communication in animals in that both involve the transmission of a message from one entity to another. In the case of biological signal transduction, the message is a signal that conveys information about the internal state of the organism. In the case of threat communication, the message is a warning that conveys information about an external threat.	biological signal transduction	Explain how biological signal transduction is similar to threat communication in animals.
