The process of glycolysis is similar, with the glucose molecule starting off by slowly entering the cell, and then speeding through the process to produce two molecules of pyruvate.	glycolysis	Explain glycolysis using an analogy involving roller coaster.
When a ball is struck by a bat, it is pushed away from the bat. This is similar to what happens when light is scattered by a particle. The light is pushed away from the particle.	anti-stokes scattering	Explain anti-stokes scattering using an analogy involving ball striking a plate.
When a ball is thrown at a plate, the ball will bounce off the plate. The ball will scatter in all directions. This is similar to what happens when light hits a particle. The light will scatter in all directions.	stokes scattering	Explain stokes scattering using an analogy involving ball striking a plate.
If you have a large number of balls and want to find the median lethal dose, you would put a target in the middle of the balls and start throwing them. You would keep throwing balls at the target until you hit it with the median number of balls. The median lethal dose is the dose at which 50% of the population would die.	median lethal dose	Explain median lethal dose using an analogy involving balls and target.
The universe is like the surface of a balloon. It is expanding and growing.	universe	Explain universe using an analogy involving surface of a balloon.
The lock and key analogy is a comparison between enzymes and locks. Enzymes are like locks because they have a specific shape that is needed to bind to a specific substrate. The substrate is like the key because it fits into the enzyme's lock and allows the reaction to take place.	enzyme mechanism	Explain enzyme mechanism using an analogy involving lock and key.
If you are trying to find a signal in the noise, you would use an ANOVA. This is because ANOVA is a way to test the difference between the means of several groups. This is helpful because it can help you to find the signal in the noise by identifying which groups are different from each other.	anova	Explain anova using an analogy involving finding signal in the noise.
The hypothalamus is like the thermostat in your house. It controls the temperature by turning on the furnace (or air conditioner) when it gets too cold (or hot) and turning it off when the temperature is right.	thermostat	Explain thermostat using an analogy involving hypothalamus.
The water level in a dam is analogous to the concentration of a chemical species in a chemical equilibrium. The water level in the dam is analogous to the concentration of a chemical species in a chemical equilibrium. The water level in the dam is analogous to the concentration of a chemical species in a chemical equilibrium.	chemical equilibrium	Explain chemical equilibrium using an analogy involving water level in dam and lake.
Just-in-time is like a river. The rocks are the just-in-time inventory and the water is the flow of new product. The rocks are always there, but the water is constantly moving.	just-in-time	Explain just-in-time using an analogy involving water and rocks.
The immune system can be thought of as police headquarter. The headquarter is in charge of all the officers in the city. It receives information from the officers on the ground and makes decisions on how to best respond. The immune system is in charge of all the cells in the body and it receives information from the cells on the ground. It makes decisions on how to best respond.	adaptive immunity	Explain adaptive immunity using an analogy involving police headquerters.
If you have one cat and one mouse, and you put a cake in the middle of the room, the cat will eventually catch the mouse. The cat represents the voltage, the mouse represents the current, and the cake represents the resistance.	ohm's law	Explain ohm's law using an analogy involving cats, mice and cake.
Transcription is like photocopying a document. The document is the original, and the photocopy is a copy of the original.	transcription	Explain transcription using an analogy involving photocopying.
The xerox machine analogy for RNA polymerase is that it is the machine that copies the DNA into RNA. It is responsible for reading the DNA sequence and creating a new RNA molecule that is an exact copy of the original DNA sequence.	rna polymerase	Explain rna polymerase using an analogy involving xerox machine.
The ribosome is like a cook. The cook takes the ingredients and makes a meal. The ribosome takes the genetic instructions and makes a protein.	ribosome	Explain ribosome using an analogy involving cook.
An activator protein is like a bookmark. It helps to keep track of where a particular gene is located so that it can be turned on when needed.	activator protein	Explain activator protein using an analogy involving bookmarks.
Electricity is like air flowing through a tube. Just as the air can flow more easily through a wider tube, electricity can flow more easily through a wider wire. Just as the air can flow more slowly through a narrower tube, electricity can flow more slowly through a narrower wire.	electric circuit	Explain electric circuit using an analogy involving air flowing through a tube.
Electricity is like a flow of water through a hose. The metal rings are like the water faucet, and the rope is like the hose. When you turn on the faucet, the water flows through the hose. When you turn off the faucet, the water stops flowing.	electric circuit	Explain electric circuit using an analogy involving rope through metal rings.
The hydrophobic effect is similar to a group of teenagers at a party. The teenagers are all crowded together and talking, but as soon as one of them steps away from the group they become much more noticeable. The same thing happens with water molecules; when they are close together they are hidden by the other water molecules, but as soon as one of them moves away they become much more visible.	hydrophobic effect	Explain hydrophobic effect using an analogy involving teenagers at a party.
When an animal perceives a threat, it sends a signal to its brain to activate the fight-or-flight response. This signal is transmitted through the nervous system, which is like a telephone line between the brain and the rest of the body. The signal is transmitted as an electrical impulse, which is like a message that travels along a wire.	biological signal transduction	Explain biological signal transduction using an analogy involving threat communication in animals.
