When you touch a metal object, like a door knob, it creates an electric field. This field is made up of tiny negative and positive charges that are spread out over a large area. If you were to place two pieces of paper near each other on the floor, with enough space in between them so that no charges could flow from one piece of paper to the other through air (known as an insulator), then when you touched the metal doorknob all those tiny little electric fields would combine together into one big electric field. That's how capacitance works - by combining small amounts of electricity, we can create bigger ones.	capacitance	Use an analogy to explain capacitance.
Think of capacitors as a sponge. When you fill it with water, the sponge expands and becomes more porous. Capacitors do the same thing when they're filled with electricity and charged up.

Kirchoff's voltage law can be explained as a measure of the electrical potential difference between two points.	kirchoff's voltage law	Use an analogy to explain kirchoff's voltage law.
Think of a battery as a mini power plant. Just like a real power plant, you need to supply it with energy in order for it to generate electricity - just like your computer needs an input of electrons in order to work. But unlike a regular power plant, the voltage provided by batteries is always constant (unless you deliberately try and discharge them too quickly). This is because when you charge or discharge your battery, all the electric charges stored within are transferred across the cell's surface at once. Therefore, the voltage remains constant until there's some change detected - which could be either an increase or decrease in current flow through the cells.	kirchoff's voltage law	Use an analogy to explain kirchoff's voltage law.
The voltage law can be likened to the way a garden hose works. When you turn on the faucet, water starts flowing out of the hose until it reaches its maximum limit. The same thing happens with electricity. When you plug in an electric appliance such as a lamp or fan, electricity begins flowing into the circuit until it reaches its maximum limit - which is usually called your "household" wiring's "breakaway capacity."	kirchoff's voltage law	Use an analogy to explain kirchoff's voltage law.
Kirchhoff's voltage law can be likened to a traffic rule that states "No left turn at red." This analogy is appropriate because like the traffic rule, Kirchoff's voltage law dictates basic safety principles for electrical circuits.	kirchoff's voltage law	Use an analogy to explain kirchoff's voltage law.
Imagine a garden hose. If you turn the faucet on, water starts flowing out of the spigot and towards the end of the hose. The voltage (or electrical pressure) is high at first because a lot of water is coming out quickly. As more and more water flows through the hose, however, the voltage drops because there's less and less pressure pushing against it. In other words, as electric current flow through an object or system, its voltage will drop proportionally.	kirchoff's voltage law	Use an analogy to explain kirchoff's voltage law.
A density wave is like a ripple in a pond. The water seems to move along the surface of the pond, but if you look closer you will see that there are small waves moving underneath the surface. This is exactly what happens with matter when it is subjected to a force: tiny ripples spread out and create larger ones.	nature of a density wave	Use an analogy to explain nature of a density wave.
Think of a wave as a succession of peaks and valleys. When waves reach the shore, they form an even surface called a beach. The height of each peak is determined by how much energy was put into the wave at its source - in other words, how forceful the ocean's tide was. Just like with regular waves, there are different types of density waves. To understand them, think about what makes up water: salt and fresh water mix together to create different colors on swimming pools' walls or raindrop lenses when you pour it from one container to another. Density waves are just like these examples - except that instead of liquid substances mixing together, particles in gas (like air) mix together! And because gas molecules move around much faster than liquids or solid matter, they can pack more closely together than either liquid or solid particles would be able to do alone.	nature of a density wave	Use an analogy to explain nature of a density wave.
A density wave is like a ripple in the ocean. It's caused by something hitting the water and making waves. The bigger the thing that makes the waves, the bigger the ripple.	nature of a density wave	Use an analogy to explain nature of a density wave.
A density wave is similar to a tsunami in that they are both waves with large amplitude and relatively short duration. In the case of a density wave, however, the height of the waves is determined by how dense the atmosphere is above the ground. This means that density waves can be much more dramatic than tsunamis, as they are often accompanied by high winds and loud thundering sounds.	nature of a density wave	Use an analogy to explain nature of a density wave.
A density wave is like a ripple in a pond. As you rock the pond, the surface waves move up and down, but at regular intervals there are also small fluctuations in depth called crests (or more technically, maxima). These waves look like bumps on the surface of water.	nature of a density wave	Use an analogy to explain nature of a density wave.

Enzymes are like cars. You put gas in the car, turn the key, and it starts. But you don't have to do all that work yourself; there's an engine built into the car that does most of the work for you.

Just as that converter saves gas by breaking down chemical pollutants into less harmful components, enzymes speed up the metabolic process by cleaving food molecules into their component parts. In other words, they help us get more out of what we eat!	enzymes	Use an analogy to explain enzymes.
An analogy for the human active memory system would be a filing cabinet. When you need to remember something, you go to the cabinet and look for the file that contains information about what you are looking for. Once you find it, you open it and read through its contents. If there is anything that is unclear or new information, you might ask a friend or family member who has already been briefed on the subject matter if they can clarify any points for you. After verifying that everything is understood, you put the file back in its rightful place and move on to other tasks until later when your memory needs resurface again.	human active memory system	Use an analogy to explain human active memory system.
An analogy to explain human active memory system could be likening it to a computer's hard drive.

Think of your active memory as an electronic filing cabinet. All the information you need is right at your fingertips, but it's up to you to find it and put it in the correct folder. You have to be disciplined about remembering where everything is because if you don't keep track of what's where, bad things can happen - like forgetting why you're looking for a particular document in the first place.	human active memory system	Use an analogy to explain human active memory system.
The human active memory system is like a filing cabinet with drawers that are constantly being filled and emptied. The brain continuously retrieves information from the active memory system to use it for current tasks.	human active memory system	Use an analogy to explain human active memory system.
An analogy to explain human active memory system can be likening it to a filing cabinet. When you need something from your file cabinet, you go looking for the folder that contains what you are looking for.

Sometimes we have to search our memories and think about where we stored the information before we can recall it.	human active memory system	Use an analogy to explain human active memory system.
The rate-determining step of a reaction is like the first muscle in your body that you learn to move - it's hard at first but with practice, you can do amazing things. When you push on the ground with your feet, the earth pushes back and helps you run faster. In chemistry, this process is called forward motion or catalyst exchange. The more force (or energy) you put into pushing against something else, the quicker it will happen - this is why heat makes things move faster.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Use an analogy to explain rate-determining step of a reaction.
A rate law is like a recipe for making cookies. You need the right ingredients, and you have to follow the instructions carefully to get the right results. In chemistry, each step in a reaction is like a ingredient in a cookie dough mixture. The order in which these steps are taken affects how quickly the dough will rise and form cookies.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Use an analogy to explain rate-determining step of a reaction.
The rate-determining step of a reaction is like the button that starts the race. In order for the reaction to happen, you have to push that button quickly so everyone can start running.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Use an analogy to explain rate-determining step of a reaction.
In a chemical reaction, the rate-determining step is like walking into a burning building to save someone. If you can get to the person in time, then your heroic act will probably help them survive. However, if you don't get there in time, then your efforts are ultimately fruitless. Just as it would be impossible for someone to stop or reverse the course of a chemical reaction without first intervening (by heating or adding reactants), it's also nearly impossible to speed up or slow down a reaction without additional input (like agitation or air).	rate-determining step of a reaction	Use an analogy to explain rate-determining step of a reaction.
The rate-determining step of a chemical reaction is like the first step in an escalator: it determines how fast the entire process will move.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Use an analogy to explain rate-determining step of a reaction.

Column chromatography is like rainbows. Just as in nature, light travels in columns and these columns are made up of tiny droplets called solutes. As the column filled with solute solution moves through the liquid medium, the different colors of light scatter off of each other in predictable ways. In a column chromatograph (often abbreviated to CPS), an inert carrier material (usually solid) is placed at one end of a long tube or pipe and sampled periodically (or "driven") with a high-pressure stream of solvent from the other end. The various eluents travel down this column and impinge on different regions of the stationary phase which separates them based on their composition	column chromatography	Use an analogy to explain column chromatography.
Imagine you are packing a picnic basket for a day at the park. You have food, drinks, and blankets in your bag, but you need to find an appropriate container to hold them all. You could stack the food inside of each other like Russian dolls, or wrap it up in foil so that it is contained but easy to grab. The same concept can be used when column chromatography is being performed on samples: the different compounds will occupy specific spots along the column (like spaces in a Russian doll), which allows them to be separated easily.	column chromatography	Use an analogy to explain column chromatography.
Dynamic chemical equilibrium is like a dance. The different chemicals are moving around, trying to find the right spot to settle down and do their job.	dynamic chemical equilibrium	Use an analogy to explain dynamic chemical equilibrium.
In a dynamic chemical equilibrium, the concentrations of all the atoms and molecules in a system are constantly changing. This means that different elements will tend to become combined together to form new substances. So, for example, when salt is added to water, both salt and water molecules move around until they reach an equilibrium where each substance has the same concentration.	dynamic chemical equilibrium	Use an analogy to explain dynamic chemical equilibrium.
A dynamic chemical equilibrium is like a dance. The pairs of reactions are constantly exchanging energy, and as long as the dancers stay coordinated, they can keep moving around without falling over.	dynamic chemical equilibrium	Use an analogy to explain dynamic chemical equilibrium.
When a bee collects nectar from flowers, it simultaneously removes water and dried floral material. This activity causes the concentration of solutes (nectar) to change in response to decreased availability of water. Similarly, when metal ions are dissolved in solution they react with one another according to their equilibrium concentrations.	dynamic chemical equilibrium	Use an analogy to explain dynamic chemical equilibrium.
Imagine you are at a party and there is a lot of food. After awhile, people start to get full and some people start leaving. The leftovers from the food that was eaten earlier will be on the floor, next to the dishwashing area, and in other random places around the room. This is an analogy for chemical equilibrium. In this situation, all things are in balance (the leftovers), but if someone started picking up pieces of leftover food and putting it back into their plate, then new equilibrium would be created (a new level of distribution).	dynamic chemical equilibrium	Use an analogy to explain dynamic chemical equilibrium.

Imagine a swimming pool filled with floating rings. These are transport vesicles - tiny bubbles that help your body move things from one place to another. When you swallow, the liquid in your stomach flows into the transport vesicles and moves upward toward your intestines. This process takes about two minutes, during which time you eat and drink.	transport vesicles	Use an analogy to explain transport vesicles.

An oncogene is like a gardener who plants flowers. The gardener let’s some dirt and water seep into the flower pot, then they add a little fertilizer and water. Over time, if there are no weeds or pests in the pot, the flowers will grow taller and more robust. However, if you put an unwanted plant in with the flowers-say a weed-the weed will take over and crowd out the flowers. In much the same way, when scientists study cancer cells, they look for changes (mutations) that make them behave differently from normal cells. These altered behaviors may be caused by something called an oncogene; when these mutations occur repeatedly within a cell population (gene), it can give rise to cancers [source: Mayo Clinic].	oncogenes	Use an analogy to explain oncogenes.

The analogy I would use to explain resonance hybrid is that it is like two singers singing together in a choir. The first singer sings their normal voice and the second singer echoes what the first singer has sung. This creates a harmonic sound because the two voices are working in unison with each other.	resonance hybrid	Use an analogy to explain resonance hybrid.
A resonance hybrid is like two tuning forks that are vibrating in unison. The higher frequency fork will pick up the lower frequency fork's vibrations and continue to resonate, causing the sound to get louder and smoother.	resonance hybrid	Use an analogy to explain resonance hybrid.
When two musical instruments are played together, their sound waves create a resonance hybrid. This occurs when the frequencies of each instrument match up and create a harmonic vibration. The result is an amplified sound that is richer than either individual instrument alone. In much the same way, resonance hybrids can occur between different parts of our body and our environment. They can help us to feel more connected and harmonious within ourselves and with those around us	resonance hybrid	Use an analogy to explain resonance hybrid.
A resonance hybrid is like a musical tuning fork. The two metal prongs of the fork create an oscillation when they touch each other, and this frequency can be changed by adjusting how far apart the forks are. Resonance hybrids work in a similar way - they overlap or "resonate" with one another to create energy that can be used to power devices	resonance hybrid	Use an analogy to explain resonance hybrid.
An analogy to explain resonance hybrid would be a guitar string. Imagine if you taped one end of the string to your hand and plucked it with the other hand. You can hear the string ringing because of the energy that was put into producing that sound. Resonance is kind of like this, only in reverse. Instead of vibration moving along the length of the string, it's energy moving back and forth between two objects (or sometimes more than two).	resonance hybrid	Use an analogy to explain resonance hybrid.
A wave is an example of a mechanical model. A wave is like a series of tiny water droplets that move up and down in response to a force (like the waves on the ocean). The shape of the waves depends on how strong the force is.	wave mechanical model	Use an analogy to explain wave mechanical model.
Think of a wave as an extended piece of water. When the wave is small, the surface of the water is smooth and it looks like a continuous line. As the wave grows, the crests and troughs become more pronounced until finally there are waves towering high into the air on one side and crashing down onto the beach on the other.	wave mechanical model	Use an analogy to explain wave mechanical model.
Wave mechanical model is like a wave on the ocean. The water molecules are like tiny balls and when they move, they push each other out of the way. This creates a waveform that moves along the surface of the ocean.	wave mechanical model	Use an analogy to explain wave mechanical model.
A wave is like a series of crashing waves on the shore. The first wave builds up speed as it hits the water and then crashes down, throwing water in all directions. As the next wave approaches, it also builds up speed until it crashes down, creating another spray of water. This process continues until you reach the point where there are no more waves.	wave mechanical model	Use an analogy to explain wave mechanical model.
The wave mechanical model is like a boat in the ocean. The boat has two parts, the bow and the stern. The bow is always moving forward while the stern moves backwards. When the wave passes by, it makes water turbulence that causes the boat to move from side to side.	wave mechanical model	Use an analogy to explain wave mechanical model.

Replication of DNA is like flipping a switch. When the switch is turned on, the lights turn on. In the same way, when replication of DNA occurs in cells, it starts with one strand of genetic material (known as DNA) and ends up with two identical copies of that strand. This process is referred to as transcription and translation, respectively. Like turning on a light bulb, activation of replication allows molecules to interact and carry out their specific functions.(Healthline)	dna replication	Use an analogy to explain dna replication.
Replication is like the process of copying a document from one place to another. The dna in our cells contains the instructions for making copies of itself. When we need those instructions, we activate the replication machinery and let it take care of the job.	dna replication	Use an analogy to explain dna replication.
The replication of DNA is like a chain reaction. When one piece of DNA is copied, it can pass on its instructions to another part of the cell. That new section then starts copying itself, and so on, until the entire chromosome has been duplicated.	dna replication	Use an analogy to explain dna replication.
DNA replication is like a factories that produces products. Similar to the factory, DNA replication makes duplicate copies of the genes in cells.	dna replication	Use an analogy to explain dna replication.
Think of replication as a virus copying itself. The first step in replicating a virus is to attach its DNA, or genetic material, to the host cell's chromosome. This process is called penetration and it allows the viral genome to be copied into the host cell's nucleus. Once inside the nucleus, molecular machinery starts chopping up the viral DNA and creating new copies of it. These newly created viruses can then start spreading through your body by infecting other cells.	dna replication	Use an analogy to explain dna replication.
Imagine you are on a long train ride and the conductor announces that we will be arriving at our next stop in fifteen minutes. Your car is filled with passengers, both sitting and standing, so naturally everyone starts milling around preparing to disembark. But then the conductor says there's been a delay - the train won't actually pull into the station for another twenty minutes! So now people are starting to get antsy. They start going back to their seats, chatting and reading magazines. Some people even go outside to smoke cigarettes or grab some lunch from one of the vendors who have set up camp near the tracks. And finally, after what seems like an eternity but was really only fifteen minutes, we arrive at our final destination without further incident. This is analogous to how rna transcription works - when scientists say they're going to transcribe a particular gene within a given time frame, most of them mean it. However, sometimes things happen that extend this timeline (a difficult sequence being transcribed takes longer than usual), but eventually everything goes according to plan and results are produced as expected	rna transcription	Use an analogy to explain rna transcription.
Transcription is like turning on a light switch. The gene's blueprint is turned into working instructions for making the protein.	rna transcription	Use an analogy to explain rna transcription.
RNA transcription is similar to turning a page in a book. The instructions for making protein are written on the DNA strand, but the actual process of translating those instructions into proteins happens when a copy of the gene's sequence (the rna transcript) is made from RNA.	rna transcription	Use an analogy to explain rna transcription.
Transcription is like printing a document on paper using ink. RNA molecules are like the type of paper that can be printed, while DNA molecules are like the ink used to print the document. The RNA molecule copies what's written in the DNA molecule, and then it leaves the cell that made it.	rna transcription	Use an analogy to explain rna transcription.
You can think of rna transcription as turning your computer's hard drive into a tape recorder. As the information is copied from one location on the hard drive to another, it becomes an audio file that you can play back.	rna transcription	Use an analogy to explain rna transcription.
A translation analogy would liken protein translation to a relay race. The messenger RNA (mRNA) is the baton and the amino acid sequence of the desired protein is its track. Multiple proteins join together to make one elongated chain, which then gets carried along by the mRNA while it hops from nucleotide to nucleotide in a process called transcription. Once DNA replication has completed, this new mRNA strand will be injected into cells' ribosomes where it will find matching codons with which to code for each amino acid – just like runners timing their strides as they pass through checkpoints on footrace course. Finally, these individual peptides are assembled into larger polypeptides inside the cell's lysosome-like structure and released back out again into circulation where they can do their thing!	protein translation	Use an analogy to explain protein translation.
Imagine you are translating a book from one language to another. You have the original text in your native language, and you need to find the equivalent text in your target language. In order to do this, you need to locate all of the words that are equal in both languages and figure out their corresponding locations within the sentence or paragraph. Then, you use those word locations as starting points and translate each word according to its corresponding location within the new sentence or paragraph. This process is repeated until you have translated every word in the text into your target language.	protein translation	Use an analogy to explain protein translation.
Think of protein translation as driving a car. The instructions for how to build the cars are encoded in DNA, and when you want to start the engine, you put the key into the ignition. The thing holding your car together is called metal—in this analogy it's analogous to the polypeptides that make up proteins. Now imagine that instead of oil being pumped into your engine, there was an invisible fluid called RNA (ribonucleic acid). This fluid is what gets converted by enzymes into amino acids, which form chains and interact with each other according to specific rules; these interactions then produce proteins. So just like turning on your car's engine starts all those gears working, getting proteins from theirRNA template involves activating all sorts of biochemical reactions	protein translation	Use an analogy to explain protein translation.
When you hear someone speak a foreign language, their mouth and vocal chords are responsible for translating the sounds into words that your brain can understand. Your eyes translate those visuals into letters on a page so that you can read what was said. The same thing happens with protein translation - once the genetic code of the gene is transcribed from DNA to RNA, it's up to proteins called ribosomes to properly interpret and carry out instructions encoded within the mRNA molecule.	protein translation	Use an analogy to explain protein translation.
Think of protein translation as a process where someone is translating the written word from one language to another. In this analogy, the "someone" is the cell's proteins, and the "word" is the genetic code that tells cells what to do.	protein translation	Use an analogy to explain protein translation.

Think of a wave travelling down the length of an ocean liner. As the wave approaches the shore, it follows the coastline before gradually receding back out to sea.

Imagine a long, narrow stream flowing through the forest. If someone were to jump into the stream from one side, they would quickly be carried downstream to where the current flows quickest.

The breathing mechanism of a frog is like the way your car breaths when it's running. Your car has two things that help it breathe: the engine and the exhaust system. Your car uses both to breath in air and exhale gas. The engine breathes with its piston, and when it's working really hard, it can even make noise! The exhaust system takes all that gas out of the engine and pipes it outside where you can see it blowing away. When you're driving down the street, if you stop at a red light and turn your car off, you'll see all those fumes coming out of your tailpipe!	breathing mechanism of frogs	Use an analogy to explain breathing mechanism of frogs.
A frog breathes through its skin and lungs. The skin is like a filter that helps to remove dirt, dust, and other things from the air that the frog breaths in.

The breathing mechanism of frogs is like that of humans- they inhale and exhale through their mouth. However, the frog's lungs are much smaller than a human's, so it takes more air to fill them up. This causes the frog to pant when it needs to get air, which is an indication of its excitement or fear.	breathing mechanism of frogs	Use an analogy to explain breathing mechanism of frogs.

The analogy I would use to explain limiting reactant and excess reactant is that of a cook trying to make a stew. The cook has two pots - one with the necessary ingredients, and another with an excess of those ingredients. If the cook tries to mix all the ingredients from both pots together, it will not work because there are not enough nutrients for everyone. In much the same way, when reacting substances combine in reactions they do so in ratios which allow for either a limited or unlimited amount of products formed (depending on how many moles each substance contains).	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Use an analogy to explain limiting reactant and excess reactant.

If you have too much sugar in your drink, it will turn into syrup.

The metabolic process of glycolysis can be likened to the turning of a key in a lock. The sugar molecule (a carbonyl group plus an oxygen atom) is first drawn into the active site network, where it is attacked by two enzymes - pyruvate kinase and acetyl-CoA synthase. These enzymes use energy from ATP to cleave off one carbon unit from the sugar molecule, creating two three-carbon molecules of glucose. Glucose then moves on through several other steps until it is converted into energy and used by cells for fuel.	glycolysis	Use an analogy to explain glycolysis.

Once it gets to the engine, the gas combines with oxygen from the atmosphere to create heat, mechanical energy, water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrogen oxide (NOx).	glycolysis	Use an analogy to explain glycolysis.
Metabolic pathways are like a series of interconnected highways.

A jar of mixed colors is sitting on a shelf in the sun. If you add blue to one side, the color will spread evenly to all sides of the jar because chemical equilibrium has been achieved. However, if you add yellow to the other side, only a thin layer of yellow will be present on that side because not enough blue was added to counteract it.	chemical equilibrium	Use an analogy to explain chemical equilibrium.
Think of it as a scale. On one end is Chaos, with huge fluctuations and movement. In the middle is order, with everything working together in accordance to a plan.

An analogy to describe adaptive immunity is a defense system that uses different antibodies against different invaders.	adaptive immunity	Use an analogy to explain adaptive immunity.
Adaptive immunity is like a personal shield that the body uses to protect itself from infection. The immune system starts by recognizing specific invaders, such as bacteria and viruses, and forming antibodies to fight them. Once an antibody has been created, it alerts the immune system when it encounters the same invader again. This process is repeated until the individual no longer experiences any symptoms of a disease.	adaptive immunity	Use an analogy to explain adaptive immunity.
An analogy to explain adaptive immunity can be described as the body's natural way of defending itself from invading viruses, bacteria, or other harmful organisms.

This process is often effective at protecting the body from infection, though it can take time for the immune system to fully develop an defense against a particular type of threat.	adaptive immunity	Use an analogy to explain adaptive immunity.
Adaptive immunity is like a lock and key. The body has a set of locks that protect it from different types of invaders. For example, the immune system may have locked onto bacteria or viruses to destroy them before they can do any damage. Once an intruder is identified, the immune system will find its corresponding key (usually antibodies) and use it to unlock the locks on the target cells so that the defender's arsenal can attack and kill the invader.	adaptive immunity	Use an analogy to explain adaptive immunity.

Imagine a big, heavy bucket of water. Add some soap to the top and stir it around. The soap will start to foam up and rise to the surface. Now take a straw and suck on the side of the bucket that has nothing in it -- no soap or water. You'll get little if any sucking action at all; there's just too much resistance from all that liquid surrounding the suction cup! That's how hydrophobic materials work: they have lots of liquid surrounding them, so anything trying to adhere (like dirt) is repelled by its sheer weight	hydrophobic effect	Use an analogy to explain hydrophobic effect.
Think of a swimming pool — the water is relatively "hydrophilic" because it wants to be close to the surface. But if you put some sand in the bottom, and fill up the pool with water, now all of the area around the sand will be more hydrophobic because it doesn't want anything getting near its precious cargo.	hydrophobic effect	Use an analogy to explain hydrophobic effect.
