A lysosome is like a getaway car. It's got all sorts of different tools and mechanisms inside it,0009 to clean up your messes1. When you put something into a lysosome, the pH changes so that enzymes can start working1. This process breaks down the material and creates new molecules called trashMolecules In other words, when we eat or drink something, some portion of it goes into our stomach and small intestine which syrupy mix with digestive juices from our intestines and turns into waste before being pushed out through the rectum on an empty stomach. The rest of us takes these wastes in step by step - first as gas (VO2) then as chunks (B13), then ideas (C171), proteins (Proteins folded 28S rRNA) are broken down by a group of bacteria called cellulose-degrading bacilli 2.products come floating off in solution likecsicles but they have low water Content because organic substances haven't had time to break them down yet	lysosomes	Explain lysosomes using an analogy.

The adsorbed material then moves through the column in contact with different fractions which are equipped with detectors (e.g., an ultraviolet light detector) for detection of specific materials.	column chromatography	Explain column chromatography using an analogy.
Column chromatography is the process of pushing a material through a column of material, usually with an attendant change in profile and aroma. The materials are placed in different orders according to their chemical composition and then passed through the column again, often resulting in changes in quality.	column chromatography	Explain column chromatography using an analogy.
Column chromatography is a technical method used to remove molecules from a sample by moving them through a physical medium, such as water or ether. Columns of various size are designed to accommodate different types of material, with the largest capable of holding the most substances. The particles in the media are attracted and suspended by magnetism versus gravity, which allows for more accurate separation of mixtures.	column chromatography	Explain column chromatography using an analogy.
Column chromatography is the process of removing particles from a sample by means of a columnohydraulic device. The columns are typically made of glass, plastic, cloth or other materials that adsorb molecules and permit them to flow through the devices easily. In general, the mobile molecules are moved down one side of the column while theirJob- centers become immobilized on the stationary phase at the opposite side.	column chromatography	Explain column chromatography using an analogy.
 Dynamic equilibrium is the process of ensuring that a drug or other chemical in an equation remains at its desired concentration by adjusting its properties so that it can interact with other chemicals in the mixture.	dynamic chemical equilibrium	Explain dynamic chemical equilibrium using an analogy.
Dynamic chemical equilibrium is the relationship between two molecules in an environment where energy and momentum are constantly translating from one molecule to the next. The specifics of how this works depend on a number of factors, but generally, when two molecules are in dynamic equilibrium they have equal numbers of hydrogen atoms and oxygen atoms.	dynamic chemical equilibrium	Explain dynamic chemical equilibrium using an analogy.
 Dynamic chemical equilibrium is the process by which a mixture of chemicals behaves like two individual substances that are in physical contact with each other. This happens when an applied force, such as heat, changes the balance between the molecules in a given material.	dynamic chemical equilibrium	Explain dynamic chemical equilibrium using an analogy.
 Dynamic chemical equilibrium is like a kitchen scale. When you place something on the scale, it starts at zero and slowly becomes more heavy as it rises. The same happens with molecules during dynamic chemical equilibrium.	dynamic chemical equilibrium	Explain dynamic chemical equilibrium using an analogy.
When two substances are in equilibrium, they cannot interact with each other until one of them leaves the layer. This is because the amount of each substance that is in a particular layer is equal to the amount of both substances in the same layer minus any reactants or products that have been created by either person or molecule during chemical reaction.	dynamic chemical equilibrium	Explain dynamic chemical equilibrium using an analogy.
A vacuole is a small formed part of the body that stores food. The vacuum created by the breaking down of food in the stomach forces liquids and solids to escape from the vacuole and these substances are combined and eliminated throughthe normal eliminations process.	vacuole	Explain vacuole using an analogy.
A vacuole is a small, space-like structure in the body that stores air and essential molecules such as nitrogen.	vacuole	Explain vacuole using an analogy.
A vacuole is a empty space in your body that stores food. When you eat, the energy of the food takes up space in the vacuole and starts to create new vacuum cleaners called macrophages. The macrophages digest the protein (includingfoods you've already eaten) and release oxygen and other essential molecules into your blood. This process helps keep your immune system functioning well by destroying harmful bacteria and viruses.	vacuole	Explain vacuole using an analogy.
A vacuole is like a small storage container for bacteria. When the proper amount of oxygen is present in the air, these bacteria grow and create new cells. If too much oxygen isn't available, the bacteria die and leave behind an empty space in their vacuole.	vacuole	Explain vacuole using an analogy.
A vacuole is like a small empty space in your stomach that helps food and waste travel from your intestines to the outside world. When you eat, the energy of the food causes bits of it to break down and be absorbed into your bloodstream. These tiny pieces of meat or vegetable can also create toxins if they stay long in your intestine (this is why solo travelers are often advised not to bring any big sum of money with them on their trip). Eventually these things end up coming out through your nose and mouth as bile, which we all excrete when we're sick or stressed.	vacuole	Explain vacuole using an analogy.
A transport vesicle is like a water droplet. When you blink, your eyes scatter specks of light in all directions. The same happens with a transport vesicle. When you suck on it, the gas inside the vesicle compressed and expands rapidly.	transport vesicles	Explain transport vesicles using an analogy.
 Transport vesicles are like liquids that move through a medium. They are made up of molecules that interact with one another to create a liquid state. When you moving liquid molecules around in a container, the movement is called waves because each molecule is affected by every other molecule in the wave at the same time. The biggest difference between transport vesicles and regular liquids is that transport Vesicles can be stored for long periods of time before they eventually flow out again.	transport vesicles	Explain transport vesicles using an analogy.
A transport vesicle is like a container in which drugs are delivered over a short distance. The drug travels through the vesicle and into the body, where it affects cells in an uncontrolled way.	transport vesicles	Explain transport vesicles using an analogy.
A transport vesicle is like a water droplet. When you add air to it, the vesicles expand and push each other up and out of the liquid. This happens because transportation energy (themselves) pushes the molecules closer to one another and since they are small, they can all fit in one spot.	transport vesicles	Explain transport vesicles using an analogy.
A transport vesicle is like a water droplet. When you touch it, you feel the force of the wind pushing it down into your cup. This makes a very good analogy because when I talk about transports in terms of energy, concentration, and volume (discussed below), these are all things that transported material has in common - they are all pushed along by tiny forces like wind.	transport vesicles	Explain transport vesicles using an analogy.
Proto-oncogenes are proteins that play a role in the initiation and progression of oncogenesis.	proto-oncogenes	Explain proto-oncogenes using an analogy.

Oncogenes are genes that can increase the risk of cancer.	oncogenes	Explain oncogenes using an analogy.
There are genes that cause certain diseases while there are also gene products ( chemicals) that bind to a particular receptor on the cell's surface and allow the cell to make an action hormone. The process of making a hormone is called transcription. There are about 50,000 human genes and only 1% of them encode proteins that can actually do something — the other 99% just produce methyl donors or cofactors. So it's like hiring someone: only 1 in 100 people have any real impact; most of us just help out around the house.	oncogenes	Explain oncogenes using an analogy.
A tumor is like a bluish-white virus. It can spread through contact with other people or things, and when it does, it multiplies in the body. Oncogenes are genes that make something like cancer cells more likely to develop.	oncogenes	Explain oncogenes using an analogy.
Oncogenes are genes that encode proteins that can promote or inhibit the growth of tumors.	oncogenes	Explain oncogenes using an analogy.
Tumor suppressor genes are like plants that have genetic instructions telling them not to produce branches and flowers. This is because the body can't use these genes to generate new tumors, so they don't carry any disease-causing mutations.	tumor suppressor genes	Explain tumor suppressor genes using an analogy.
Tumor suppressors are genes that keep the body from expressing tumors. For example, there is a tumor suppressor gene for breast cancer, which means that if you have this disease, your cells won't produce tumors.	tumor suppressor genes	Explain tumor suppressor genes using an analogy.
Tumor suppressors are genes that help to prevent the growth of tumors. For example, some cancer cells can't grow because they have a tumor suppressor gene.	tumor suppressor genes	Explain tumor suppressor genes using an analogy.
Tumor suppressors are genes that decrease the production of tumor cells. Some examples of these genes include TP53, a gene that controls cell proliferation and transformation, and c-Myc, which regulates the expression of many cancer-associated genes.	tumor suppressor genes	Explain tumor suppressor genes using an analogy.
Tumor suppressors are genes that help cells control the growth and spread of tumors. They do this by controlling how many cells a tumor can produce and by controlling which cell types can develop into tumors.	tumor suppressor genes	Explain tumor suppressor genes using an analogy.
Brittle software is like a LEGO sheet. It can be folded in half, but it will always be recognisable as a LEGO sheet.	brittle software	Explain brittle software using an analogy.
Brittle software is like a door that doesn't hold up very well when you try to push it.	brittle software	Explain brittle software using an analogy.
If you broke a mirror, the shards would fly all around your room. If you break a software product, the pieces might not be reunited until later when someone tries to use it again.	brittle software	Explain brittle software using an analogy.
In brittle software, parts are frequently weak or easily damaged. When a part is hit by something else, such as a hard object, the plastic material near the hard object can burst and cause contamination. The same principle applies to software: when small pieces don't hitch together correctly, it can make it difficult to get work done.	brittle software	Explain brittle software using an analogy.
A brittle software is like a piece of glass. The more you hit it, the stronger it becomes. If you keep hitting it, eventually the glass will shatter.	brittle software	Explain brittle software using an analogy.
A resonant frequency is the frequency of a sound that creates a resonance with other forms of sound. In loudspeakers, for example, the frequencies at which they create reverberation are determined by how well they resonate with each other.	resonance hybrid	Explain resonance hybrid using an analogy.
 Resonance hybrid is a type of sound where two or more sounds are combined to create a new unique sound.	resonance hybrid	Explain resonance hybrid using an analogy.
A resonant system is a set of objects that can be heard as if they were one object. This happens when the frequencies of the objects are in resonance - they both produce sound waves that are louder than any other wave form and at the same time, have the same amplitude.	resonance hybrid	Explain resonance hybrid using an analogy.
A resonant moment is the relationship between two objects in a system. The more massive object has more mass than the lessmassive object, so it experiences an increased amount of pressure when banging against the much smaller object. This increase in pressure creates a resonance and causes them to share some characteristics.	resonance hybrid	Explain resonance hybrid using an analogy.
A resonator is a material that can resonate with other materials, like voices or sound waves. When you put your ear close to the resonator, you can hear what it's saying. By doing this, we can create sounds by resonance.	resonance hybrid	Explain resonance hybrid using an analogy.
A wave is like a group of water droplets that move in a specific direction. The way the waves travel through the air affects how they sound and look.	wave mechanical model	Explain wave mechanical model using an analogy.
A wave is like a movement of water. Water moves in waves because the water pressure inside a container (like your hands) or on the outside of the container can make waves that go outwards. The same thing happens with particles in an environment, like my hands holding them up. If I hold my hand up and put some other object in between my fingers (a rock), there will be two waves created - one from my hand and the other from the rock.	wave mechanical model	Explain wave mechanical model using an analogy.
A wave is a rise and fall of water molecules in a liquid or gas. In computing, waves are typically represented by rectangular waveshapes with two main properties: short-wavelength (lower) and long-wavelength (higher).	wave mechanical model	Explain wave mechanical model using an analogy.
A wave is like a river. The water moves in all directions, but the peak (high) and trough (low) of the waves are always at thesame place. This is why waves look like they're moving up and down - they are!	wave mechanical model	Explain wave mechanical model using an analogy.
A wave is a type of energy that travels through space-time as a series of individual,scillating waves. A particle in the presence of waves can be described by its position and velocityvector at each time point along the line where the wave arrives.	wave mechanical model	Explain wave mechanical model using an analogy.
A electroencephalograph (EEG) is a recording machine that records the electrical activity of the brain. The data are collected in cycles, or waves, and can be studied to see how the brain processes information.	electroencephalogram	Explain electroencephalogram using an analogy.
An electroencephalogram is like a time-lapse video of an individual's brain waves. The patterns in the EEG show how active or inactive different parts of the brain are.	electroencephalogram	Explain electroencephalogram using an analogy.
An electroencephalograph measures the activity of your brain waves. like a sound card, an ECG records how often these waves are going through the area where you're lying. When you experience emotions or have a seizure, your brainwaves will go up and down in rates.	electroencephalogram	Explain electroencephalogram using an analogy.
An electroencephalogram is like a map of an individual's brain waves.	electroencephalogram	Explain electroencephalogram using an analogy.

The color code used to show these signals can be helpful for understanding what's going on inside your head.	electroencephalogram	Explain electroencephalogram using an analogy.
Replication is like a party. Each person brings their own drink, and everyone has a few to share. The bottle gets filled up, but nobody knows how much more they will want. Eventually, everyone drinks too much and the party dies down. That's what happens with DNA replication: It fills up the bottle until somebody ends up too drunk or sick to continue.	dna replication	Explain dna replication using an analogy.
Dna replication is like a blood transfusion. When you give someone a new set of red blood cells, they need to get some of the old ones too since their body doesn't remember how to use the old ones. The same thing happens when you copy your DNA.	dna replication	Explain dna replication using an analogy.
Dna replication is like baking a cake. You mix all the ingredients and then put them in an oven, and when they are baked, the recipe tells you how to make it come out looking like something great. The same thing happens with dna replication—you mix all the ingredients and then put them in an assay tube, and when they are analyzed, you get a report on how many copies of each stock DNA there were.	dna replication	Explain dna replication using an analogy.
If you copy the text of a book, you are essentially copying the publisher's design. To make sure that the copied text is accurate, an editor verifies that all passages have been properly quoted and footnoted. This process ensures accuracy in any translation or republication of a books.	dna replication	Explain dna replication using an analogy.
A blood transfusion is a process in which donated white blood cells are combined with red blood cells from another person to form a new batch of Hematology patients. Dna replication is also a process that occurs during blood transfusions.	dna replication	Explain dna replication using an analogy.
RNA transcription is like drawing pictures. Each letter of the mRNA (molecule that carries the genetic instructions for making proteins) can be turned into a picture by attaching one carbon atom to an oxygen atom in a word-joinable sequence calledugar codons. The second sugar, phosphate, can also be attached to some nitrogen atoms to make new bases.	rna transcription	Explain rna transcription using an analogy.
RNA transcription is like turning pages in a book. You read the first chapter, and then you turn to the next page. The same process happens with RNA transcriptions: You input information into the mRNA (the primary unit of RNA) or ribosome, and it outputs offspring transcripts that are ready for translation into proteins.	rna transcription	Explain rna transcription using an analogy.
RNA transcription is similar to writing a story. You take a group of ideas and put them into form, or you can use rna transcription as an analogy. With RNA transcription, you add the letters that make up the word "song" together to create sentences.	rna transcription	Explain rna transcription using an analogy.
A transcript is a ready-made copy of the sequence of genetic code that exists in a living organism. When DNA is copied incorrectly, or whenainted elements (races) are added to the genome, transcripts can form.	rna transcription	Explain rna transcription using an analogy.
RNA transcription is like printing out a poem. You put the ingredients into some paper or other container, and then you pour ink on top of it. The paper gets bigger and darker as the ink spread across it. Then, someone else (the transcriber) starts adding words to the printout, one letter at a time.	rna transcription	Explain rna transcription using an analogy.
When you hear someone say, "I'm sorry," they are apologizing for or experiencing a pain or misfortune. The word "translation" is used in the same sense. Translation happens when one language into another and it can also mean going over something again and again - like with a text editor.	protein translation	Explain protein translation using an analogy.
A protein is translated into a stable form, ready for the body to use. The machinery in your body uses amino acids as building blocks to create proteins. Accessing these amino acids from the environment is how translation happens.	protein translation	Explain protein translation using an analogy.
A protein is translated from mRNA into products that are available to the body. The process of translation starts with the decryption of an amino acid sequence from a message, followed by assembly of its functional units into a product.	protein translation	Explain protein translation using an analogy.
Translation is like a song. The translated text is written on an instrument called a scribe, which is placed over the text to be copied. An operator then moves the scribe left and right to create the correct sentence based on what was originally said in English.	protein translation	Explain protein translation using an analogy.
A protein is translated into RNA, which then takes on the genetic instructions of the gene that it codes for.	protein translation	Explain protein translation using an analogy.
A ecosystem is a natural web of life and environment which interact with each other to produce environmental diversity, including species and habitats.	ecosystem	Explain ecosystem using an analogy.

A neuron's action potential is like a ' spark' that travels down the neuron's nerve fiber. When it hears something new, the neuron triggers an emissions of electricity (of voltage) and water (of hydration). These three things work together to create a waveshare experience in our brains.  The faster your sparks are travelling, the more likely they are to cause current flow through the neuron and this will activate other cells nearby which will also generate activity in turn... eventually you'll get an overall summed up electrical response that tells your brain what was processed!	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron using an analogy.
A neuron propagates an action potential down a nerve by transmitting electrical impulses from cells within the cell membrane to other cells in the nervous system.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron using an analogy.
An action potential is like a waveform in a ocean. It reaches its destination quickly and often travels along the same path twice. This analogy can help you understand how an action potential propagates down a neuron.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron using an analogy.
A neuron can propagate an action potential down its axon by passing the potassium current through the membrane and then releasing the sodium ion.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron using an analogy.
When you fire your gun, theTrigger moving up and down will cause an accelleration of current in your neurons. This is also true when you start walking - if your shoes make a good noise as you step on them, then the ground below her will also create an action potential that will travel up the neuron!	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron using an analogy.
When a frog breathes in, they open their mouth wide and inhale deeply using their trachea (upper respiratory tract). They then use their outstretched tongue to break down the air into defendants. The air is used up so the frog can continue breathing by exhalation.	breathing mechanism of frogs	Explain breathing mechanism of frogs using an analogy.
When you breathe, your windpipe opens and PCO2 (carbon dioxide) is exhaled. The frog's breathing apparatus includes a number of tiny filters that help to keep the air clean and fresh	breathing mechanism of frogs	Explain breathing mechanism of frogs using an analogy.
When you take a deep breath, your lungs push all the air out of your nose and mouth. This causes an increase in air pressure inside your lungs. The increased pressure makes it easier for blood to flow into your veins and arteries (the large tubes that carry blood throughout the body).	breathing mechanism of frogs	Explain breathing mechanism of frogs using an analogy.
When an animal or person breathes, the air goes in and out of their lungs. The frog's breathing is different from ours because they don't exhale helium gas like we do. When an animal or person inhales, the respiratory system relaxes all of the muscles around the nose and mouth so that the carbon dioxide (CO2) can be taken up by the blood.	breathing mechanism of frogs	Explain breathing mechanism of frogs using an analogy.
If you were to ask a frog how it breathes, they would use their lungs like we do. When you exhale, the frog tries to send pressure up into its stomach by using contractions of its muscles. This causes air to be forced out through the nose and mouth which then pushes what little oxygen is left in the mixture up your inhalation tube and into your lungs where it's used for respiration	breathing mechanism of frogs	Explain breathing mechanism of frogs using an analogy.
A layered architecture analogy would be like telling a child that their family is made up of many levels, each one with its own functions and responsibilities. Your parents are your bottom layer, and then your grandparents are on top, followed by you as an adult. There may be other layers beneath those until we reach some far-off level where all the people in our company or organization are at different levels.	layered architecture	Explain layered architecture using an analogy.
A computer is like a layer cake. Each one of the layers has its own function and can be data, code, or ingredients in a recipe. The processor within each machine runs the instructions that are written on top of those layered pieces to form an end product.	layered architecture	Explain layered architecture using an analogy.
A layer is a level of organization in the world of software development. In contrast, a module is an individual piece of code or data that participates in some larger system.

An analogy would be to think of a water droplet. When you walk in front of it, the water droplets will hit your shoe and fall out. That's analogous to Reactant-Excess Reactant where Reactant is the number of droplets that hit the area, and excess reactant is the number of droplets that don't hit the area.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain limiting reactant and excess reactant using an analogy.
One analogy to describe limiting reactant and excess reactant is like a pot of water known how much salt it will take each time to boil. If you add too much salt, the water won't boil as well and eventually turns out sour. The same thing happens with Reactants- if we overreact (add more reactants than what our catalyst can handle), the reaction may not go as planned or may produce an undesired product.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain limiting reactant and excess reactant using an analogy.
A limiting reactant is a substance that limits the amount of product that can be formed by reaction. An excess reactant on the other hand, is a substance that allows more product to form than was intended.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain limiting reactant and excess reactant using an analogy.
An analogy is to compare a pot of water that has been spilled and left to dry to a coffee mug filled with hot drinks. The coffee mug can hold more than one cup of coffee, but the pot of water will only hold a few tablespoons at most.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain limiting reactant and excess reactant using an analogy.
A eukaryotic cell is like a onion, with layers of cells inside the plasma membrane.

In a eukaryotic cell, the chromosomes are organized into active cells and inactive cells. The active cells contain the genetic instructions for creating new proteins and molecules. The inactive cells store food, weapons, or other materials that can be used to generate new proteins.	eukaryotic cell	Explain eukaryotic cell using an analogy.
A eukaryotic cell is like a house. The cells inside the house are all different types of animals and plants. There are different rooms in the house, each with its own set of cells. The quality of air in each room determines how well the cells inside will function. In the same way, there are many different types of eukaryotic cells within a plant or animal body, and their performance depends on the quality of air they are in.	eukaryotic cell	Explain eukaryotic cell using an analogy.

The prokaryotic cells too organize themselves into gangs or colonies, and divide their DNA among themselves to produce new proteins.	prokaryotic cell	Explain prokaryotic cell using an analogy.
A prokaryotic cell is like a small amount of air in your lungs. When you breathe, the air in your lungs gets mixed with other things and goes up into your lungs. But when you take a deep breath, all the oxygenated blood leaves your lungs and goes back to your heart. This means that prokaryotic cells are very important because they help us breathe!	prokaryotic cell	Explain prokaryotic cell using an analogy.
A prokaryotic cell is like a small apple. It has a nucleus, and the inside of the apple is made up of cells that are called mitochondria. The apple also has seeds inside it that are filled with flour and oxygen.	prokaryotic cell	Explain prokaryotic cell using an analogy.

An OS kernel is like a driver in your car. The kernel contains the information that tells your computer how to run particular tasks.	operating systems kernel	Explain operating systems kernel using an analogy.
A limiting reactant is like a pot set to boil over. It doesn't matter how much you pour in, the pot will still boil over if there's not enough water inside it. This is why you need to add more water to your reaction mixture when you're starting it out—if there isn't enough of one thing, the other thing may end up boiling over as well.	limiting reactant	Explain limiting reactant using an analogy.
If you put a big towel on the floor, it will take up a lot of space. If you have only one reactant in the container, it will directly cause the reaction that is happening. With limited reactants, there are more possible reactions going on and it can be harder to see what's happening.	limiting reactant	Explain limiting reactant using an analogy.
For a React component to work, the reactant needs two of its three components to be in place: the stateless root component and any child components. In order for there to be a stable chain reaction, each child must have an equivalent collaborator—in this case, a stateless helper class that takes input from the parent and outputs something new.	limiting reactant	Explain limiting reactant using an analogy.
An analogy would be to say that you can't pour gasoline into a fireplace without starting the fire. If you try and do it with water, it won't work.	limiting reactant	Explain limiting reactant using an analogy.
A limiting reactant is like a pot of water that can only hold so much water before it begins to overflow.

This wheel can be turned by force (the action of an enzyme) or by heat (the action of a laser). The number of revolutions per minute (rpm) produced by the helicase is controlled by its catalytic activity.	helicase	Explain helicase using an analogy.
Dna replication binding proteins are like bridges between DNA and transcription factors. They help to ensure that the correct amount of double-stranded DNA is copied during replication.	dna replication binding proteins	Explain dna replication binding proteins using an analogy.
Dna replication binding proteins are analogous to factories that produce either new strands of DNA or fragments thereof. Binding the correct piece of genetic code to the origin site forms a duplex complex, which is then replicated by the cells' DNA polymerase. The protein responsible for coordinating these steps is called a dnBinding Factor because it helps control when and how much copy each strand takes from the template.	dna replication binding proteins	Explain dna replication binding proteins using an analogy.
Dna replication binding proteins are proteins that help to sticky the duplex DNA together.	dna replication binding proteins	Explain dna replication binding proteins using an analogy.
Replication binding proteins are like a key that helps to keep copies of DNA ready for replication.	dna replication binding proteins	Explain dna replication binding proteins using an analogy.
A duplex of DNA is made up of two double stranded pieces. The Watson-Crick base pairing diagram represents the replication fork in a duplex, with each strand connected by a short linker. After one copy of the sequence has been replicated along its entirety, it can be cut down to create two shorter variants called single strands (which are not themselves repeatable). Each variant will have an extra sugar molecule attached to one end and no sugar attached to the other end. In order for these variants to attach themselves together as dna duplexes, they need something that helps them stay joined during replication - this is where replication binding proteins come in play. These proteins help tie different Variant dna duplexes together so that they can be repeated again and again without becoming tears in the fabric of DNA!	dna replication binding proteins	Explain dna replication binding proteins using an analogy.
Ligase is like a hammer that can chop wood. It works by getting two different DNA strands together and doubling them back up so they have twice the amount of genetic information. This makes it possible to make new genes from old ones.	ligase	Explain ligase using an analogy.
A ligase is like a pair of scissors. When you cut something, the two pieces that remain together eventually become one new thing. This happens with DNA, when we cut it and create new genetic material. Ligases help to join these pieces together so that they can grow larger and stronger.	ligase	Explain ligase using an analogy.
Ligase is like a chemical editor. It breaks down DNA chains into smaller pieces, which can be used to create new proteins.	ligase	Explain ligase using an analogy.

A process control block, or PCB, is a step in the management of an equipment or systems installation. It provides a central location for organizing and monitoring activities that will result in the performance of an engineering project. The PCB typically includes tables and chairs where engineers work to create plans, specifications, lists of items to be installed, estimates of time required, reviews of progress, goals and objectives - all with the aim of producing results expected by end users.	process control block	Explain process control block using an analogy.
A process control block is like a switch in a machine. When you tell the machine to do something, it flips a certainswitch and starts doing what you said it would.	process control block	Explain process control block using an analogy.
A process control block (PCB) is a group of steps that help to ensure the overall flow of a particular product or service. The PCB controls the production processes within an organization, and ensures that the products or services are delivered on time and in compliance with standards.	process control block	Explain process control block using an analogy.
A process control block (PCB) is like a traffic police officer in a city. When you see someone speeding, you pull over the driver and ask them to slow down. The same thing happens with processes: when there are too many of them going at once, they can get out of balance and cause chaos. To keep things running smoothly, PCBs make sure that each process is doing its job properly by controlling how it interacts with other processes.	process control block	Explain process control block using an analogy.
A process control block is like a check valve in a pipeline. Whenever one part of the pipeline becomes overwhelmed, it can slow down the flow of water for other parts of the pipeline. The same thing happens with our bodies: whenever we get too worked up, our muscles can brake soon after and prevent us from moving forward.	process control block	Explain process control block using an analogy.
Some people might think of encoding as wearing a chastity belt to keep theirCondom safe. Others might think of it more metaphorically, like putting on brakes when driving and using the right setting for your car's horn so you don't get pulled over.	message encoding	Explain message encoding using an analogy.
There are many ways to encode messages, but one analogy would be using a ZIP file. A ZIP file is a type of plastic container that can stores many different types of files (information). When you zip up a document, you add all the files in the folder into one big zip file. This way, if someone tries to pirate your document by extracting only some of the files from the ZIP file, they will not be able to steal any information from your document because it will have been combined together in one bigzipfile.	message encoding	Explain message encoding using an analogy.
One common way to encode text is to use a code. For example, when you send an email, you might include the sender's name and address in the headers so that recipients can easily recognize who sent what.Similarly, when making phone calls, you might use different kinds of codes (like 25 for a standard telephone call) to differentiate between different types of communication.	message encoding	Explain message encoding using an analogy.
One possible analogy for this message encoding is to think of it as a text string that has been translated into multiple languages. The first letter of the string representing the English language is called the origin letter, and all other letters are localized translations of thatOriginLetter. For example, "Hello" would be represented by A0A0 in ASCII. To encode Japanese text into an ASCII string, we'd use しんこう (shinoko).	message encoding	Explain message encoding using an analogy.
An analogy would be to say that the encoding is like a message in a text book. The code looks like letters from the alphabet, and each letter represents one bit of information.	message encoding	Explain message encoding using an analogy.
Drugs interact with receptor sites in two ways: by blocking the activity of receptors and by activating cells that are associated with the receptor. The blocked or activated cells can then produce a response to the drug, which can be monitored and analyzed using assay methods.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain interaction between drugs and receptor sites using an analogy.
Drugs work by attaching to receptors on the cell membrane. Receptors are places where chemicals that help thecell process information come in contact with other chemicals, called ligands.

This can be either an increase or decrease in activity, depending on which drug is used.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain interaction between drugs and receptor sites using an analogy.
A drug can interact with receptors at many sites, depending on the drug and its affinity. For example, a receptor may be blocked by one drug but not another, or it may be activated by oneDrug but not another.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain interaction between drugs and receptor sites using an analogy.

An analogy would be like a gasoline/fuel mixture. When you fill up your car with gasoline, the fuel is put into a tank and then the tank isfilled with air. The air pressure inside the tank will cause AIR to come out of the container (the top) and go back in to thetank (the bottom). This process happens constantly as you drive: when we fill our cars up with gas, we are filling them up with air because there is always more air in an open space than there is fuel. In similar fashion, when we mix chemicals they all have "inves" or "deposits" which create equilibrium. For example, water has both a positive invert Jona (-junction) and a negative end overpotassium (+pump): where +pump goes in→water comes out -junction becomes +wanda (+ pipeline), while -junction becomes -prime(-terminal point for chemical reaction): here wanda means water coming out of jonatic side	chemical equilibrium	Explain chemical equilibrium using an analogy.
Chemical equilibrium is the process by which all substances in a solution are at the same concentration. This occurs because when two solutions or mixtures of elements are mixed, they each get equal amount of sunlight that penetrates to the surface. The atoms in one element block the atoms in another element from entering into contact with them so these two elements have no way for their chemical reactions to take place	chemical equilibrium	Explain chemical equilibrium using an analogy.

Adaptive immunity is like a computer system that can learn and adapt to new situations. When you first set up your computer, it may be difficult for you to figure out how to work the system. But over time, your computer will become more familiar and efficient. The same thing happens with adaptive immune systems: they can learn and adapt as they encounter different types of stressors. As long as we are keeping ourimmune systems healthy by eating lots of fruits and vegetables,ieving in natural supplements, avoiding harsh chemicals, and getting enough exercise, we should be okay	adaptive immunity	Explain adaptive immunity using an analogy.
Your immune system is like a defense against infection. When you are infected with a virus, your immune system attacks the virus and destroys it.

The same happens when you are infected with an illness—your immune system fights off the infection. Adaptive immunity is produced by our bodies because they need to keep us safe from something; it's not actually innate or " default ."	adaptive immunity	Explain adaptive immunity using an analogy.
Ohm's law states that the resistance of a metal to an electric current is inversely proportional to its surface area.	ohm's law	Explain ohm's law using an analogy.
"Ohm's law" is the scientific name for an equation that states the contact pressure between two materials is inversely proportional to their electromotive force or "E".	ohm's law	Explain ohm's law using an analogy.
Ohm's law states that the current density of an electric field is inversely proportional to the length of its path.	ohm's law	Explain ohm's law using an analogy.
When you connect two metal objects together with a wire, the more resistance there is between the two metals, the higher the voltage needs to be to turn it on. The higher Voltage will also cause current through that wire in order to flow (and create heat).	ohm's law	Explain ohm's law using an analogy.
The law of Ohm's Voltage is simply the rule that total current in a circuit equals the sum of current through its individual parts.	ohm's law	Explain ohm's law using an analogy.
Transcription is like orchestrating a play. The act of reading aloud from a text, or translating it into another language, is perhaps the most basic task of transcription. Just as actors must communicate their meanings to each other in order to create an effective performance, so too do transcriptionists need to be sure that all voices are heard and that the correct spelling and punctuation are being used.	transcription	Explain transcription using an analogy.
Transcription is like angling for a fish. You need to be careful not to get your hands wet since the water will help the fish move and hiding places will provide cover.	transcription	Explain transcription using an analogy.
The transcription of a text is like printing out a document. Each letter and digit is placed on an acid-free sheet of paper, cut into the desired size, folded in half so that one edge meets the other, and sewn shut with thread. The user then instructions how to read the text.	transcription	Explain transcription using an analogy.
Transcription is like dressing up a clown. You put on clothes, but the clown is still there; you can't see him, but he's always there. The same thing happens with texts: you put them together and they become something more than just words.	transcription	Explain transcription using an analogy.
Transcription is like a stenographer taking dictation from someone else. You need to pay attention to the guidelines that the stenographer has set up, and following them will make your transcription more accurate.	transcription	Explain transcription using an analogy.
A polymerase is like a clipper that cuts DNA. The polymerase uses its power of steam to cut the DNA into short pieces, calledestycites.	rna polymerase	Explain rna polymerase using an analogy.
Rna polymerase is a machine that helps to synthesize RNA from DNA. It works by converting the two strands of DNA into RNA, and then printing out these new RNAs on specific stretches of template DNA.	rna polymerase	Explain rna polymerase using an analogy.
One analogy to explain RNA polymerase is as a spreadsheet. Every row in the spreadsheet represents one molecule of DNA that is copied during replication. Rows are continually updated as new DNA molecules are added to the sheet, and then revised when old DNA molecules are scrapped or eliminated. The process of copying the genetic code into new cells happens similarly: each column in the spreadsheet keeper track how many copies have been made of each gene (or protein) type since it was last updated.	rna polymerase	Explain rna polymerase using an analogy.
Rna polymerase is a protein that catalyzes the synthesis of RNA from DNA. It is responsible for many important cellular responses, including transcription, translation, and storage of genetic information.	rna polymerase	Explain rna polymerase using an analogy.
A polymerase is like a clothing seamer, Carlos. They pull the RNA duplexes together to make Transcripts. Transcripts are what cells use to create proteins and other molecules.	rna polymerase	Explain rna polymerase using an analogy.
A ribosome is like a seed, which can store the genetic code for proteins. The Ribosomal Protein S1 (rps1) interacts with another protein, called the RNA helicase, to form a triple helix. This triple helix then shapes and packages the protein into small pieces that are sent off to be used in an action or reaction inside of cells.	ribosome	Explain ribosome using an analogy.
A ribosome is like a small, everyday machine that helps make proteins in your body. It can read and interpret DNA data to create the proteins you need for your muscles, blood cells, and other organs.	ribosome	Explain ribosome using an analogy.
A ribosome is like a small organ in your body that helps convert mRNA into protein.	ribosome	Explain ribosome using an analogy.
A ribosome is like a pack of cards. When you put them together, they form a deck. The Ribosome is the ace of spades and it helps to build viruses.	ribosome	Explain ribosome using an analogy.
A ribosome is like a container that helps proteins to be designed into molecules. The ribosome sorts the mRNA (molecules with the genetic instructions for making proteins) from the DNA (indirectly inherited information about how one cell makes its own chromosomes). Many different enzymes help shaped these new molecules into their final form, including an enzyme called Ribonuclease E.	ribosome	Explain ribosome using an analogy.
Activator proteins are like batteries in the body. They help to keep things working by activating other proteins.	activator protein	Explain activator protein using an analogy.
Activator protein is like a key that unlocks locks on cells. When the activator protein is activated, it causes proteins to interact with each other and make enzymes. This interaction causes the cell to change its shape and function.	activator protein	Explain activator protein using an analogy.
Activator protein is like a muscle's quarterback. It helps the muscles to respond and do their jobs correctly.	activator protein	Explain activator protein using an analogy.

Activator protein (AP) is a protein that helps to activate enzymes.	activator protein	Explain activator protein using an analogy.
An electric circuit is like a flow of water. When you connect two electronic devices, the power from one device flows into and powers the other device. The same thing happens with electricity: when you connect an electrical light bulb to an outlet, the current that runs through the connections turns it on.	electric circuit	Explain electric circuit using an analogy.
An electric circuit is like a path of light in the sky. When you connect two things together, they become linked and can “talk” to each other. The same thing happens when you make an electric connection between two pieces of metal or plastic.	electric circuit	Explain electric circuit using an analogy.
An electric circuit is like a flow of water. When you touch the side of a glass tube, the liquid falls to your fingers and then rises up through the hole in the bottom of the tube. The same is true with electricity: when youtouch an electrified object (like a wire or resistor), electricity flows from one end to another.	electric circuit	Explain electric circuit using an analogy.
A electric circuit is like a wire in your house. You can touch it, and if you do it right, the electricity going through the wire will flow into the next box over there and turn on some lights.	electric circuit	Explain electric circuit using an analogy.
Electric circuits are like factories. They produce things such as electricity, heat, and motion. Electric circuits can be represented in a number of ways including Ross's diagram (shown below) or a network of wires with each wire connected to the next one in series.	electric circuit	Explain electric circuit using an analogy.
Water is a liquid because it has the property of being able to soluble in most other liquids. This means that when you put water into your mouth, it goes down your throat and then into your stomach.	hydrophobic effect	Explain hydrophobic effect using an analogy.
Water is a liquid that can bemobipped into many different shapes. Some people like to think of water as an elephant with trunk and tusk because it can look so different when you touch it.	hydrophobic effect	Explain hydrophobic effect using an analogy.
If you put a wet cloth on my hand, the water will seep into the creases of my skin and it will feel uncomfortable. This is because hydrophobic properties are like that - they make something difficult or inconvenient to get inside.	hydrophobic effect	Explain hydrophobic effect using an analogy.
A hydrophobic effect is when a material has a low ability to cause water molecules to form intimate hydrogen-bonded clouds with other materials. This can prevent the molecule from being easily attracted to other liquid substances, which can lead to an inhibition of intermolecular interactions.	hydrophobic effect	Explain hydrophobic effect using an analogy.
Water is a hydrophobic molecule because it can neither be absorbed nor catabolized by cells. This means that water molecules cannot associate with other molecules to form hybrids, and as such, often clumps together in single files or clusters on surfaces.	hydrophobic effect	Explain hydrophobic effect using an analogy.
 Biological signal transduction is the process by which cells communicate with each other through chemical signals. The communication can be broken down into five main categories: physical,chemical, nutrients, virus/host interaction and energy transfer.physical Signals are like sound waves that travel through the cell membrane and affect the genetic information in the nucleus of the cell. Chemical Signals are like chemicals that exist outside of ourCellular membranes and they typically act on enzymes to change a molecule called neurotransmitter into another one or create a new protein. Nourishment Signals come from food inside the cell and they mess with things called growth factors to make more proteins inside your Cell) Virus/Host Interactionsignals represent how viruses interact with their host (the Cells we eat). Energy Transfersignals allow energy to move between different parts of your body	biological signal transduction	Explain biological signal transduction using an analogy.
A biological signal Transduction is the process of amplifying or suppressingimiend genetic expression in cells. Signals are conveyed through a communication pathway which includes proteins and receptors.

A biological signal transduction cascade is like a pipeline that carries water from the ocean to your home. The pathway starts with an input of molecules called ions, which originate from the soil or other nearby source. These molecules then activate proteins to messengers called messenger RNAs, which travel along the pipeline and interact with other proteins to create a spark or message.	biological signal transduction	Explain biological signal transduction using an analogy.
A biological signal is like a light switch. When you turn the light on, it makes noise. The sound of the light is conveyed through the air and onto other objects. Similarly, when you send an electrical Signal via communication wires, it makes noise as well. The clarity of the message can be determined by how carefully or inaccurately the signals are transmitted	biological signal transduction	Explain biological signal transduction using an analogy.
A biological signal transduction cascade is like a switch and the input for this switch is an event, such as a hormone release. The output of the switch can be interpreted according to its type or response: if the input is high then it will lead to aaaargh!, whereas if the input is low then it will activate cdcch!	biological signal transduction	Explain biological signal transduction using an analogy.
