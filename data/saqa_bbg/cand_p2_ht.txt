Bruising is the natural result of a sudden impact. If two objects are very close together, they will both withenFrom each other and sustain some damage. This also happens when you hit your head on a hard surface - if you're quick enough, you'll minimize the damage done to your skull by dodging it. Bruises happen rapidly because the pressure of two things trying to touches each other quickly creates intense forces that can cause superficial and deeper injuries. Software is much like this - it's brittle in nature and can easily be shattered into smaller pieces if mishandled or abused.	brittle software	Using an analogy, explain brittle software.
An analogy to resonance hybrid would be as if a tuning fork was resonating with itself. When You strike the tuning fork with your thumb, you create some sound waves that are in tune with each other and also have an odd number of cycles per second.

Radium is a yellow metal found in the Earth's mantle. It has two isotopes, radium-226 and radium-227. These isotopes are intended to be used as sources of energy for nuclear reactors. Radiocarbon dating reveals that these rocks were formed about 26 million years ago. The uranium in those rocks was released when an asteroid impact caused pieces of the asteroid to hit Earth, creating earth's mantle and melting all the way down into our planet's crust!

An analogy would be to think about waves in water. A wave is like a River, it follows the curvature of the Earth's surface. The distance between two points on opposite banks of a river increases as you move downstream because each time something or someone moves up or down the river there is an increase in displacement (acceleration). This is why waves keep moving forward even when they're low at the shoreline - their displacement keeps growing and pushing everything else along with it.	wave mechanical model	Using an analogy, explain wave mechanical model.

The proteins that make up the cell's DNA are translated into RNA, which then becomes active and helps to build the proteins that our cells need	protein translation	Using an analogy, explain protein translation.
Protein translation is like painting. You start with a blank canvas and add pictures to it as you go. The more pictures that are added, the better the picture will look. In protein translation, you also need to add a message from one molecule to another in order for the two cells to communicate with each other properly.	protein translation	Using an analogy, explain protein translation.
Protein translation is like a process of translating written English words into other languages. The translator takes the original text and translates it into a different language.

The propagation of an action potential down a neuron is like theWave in a ocean. The action potential goes through the cell at a rapid pace, and it impacts every molecule inside the cell. This causes your muscles to contract and make you feel movement.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Using an analogy, explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron.
A neuron propagates an action potential down its axon. Axons are long and thinoodle-like fibers that connect brain cells. The action potential flows along the axon like a river, pushing adjacent neurons in one direction and pulling neighboring neurons towards the attacking cell	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Using an analogy, explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron.
A neuron's action potential travels down its axon, which is a long and thin conducting system.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Using an analogy, explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron.
An action potential is a wireless communication between neurons. When an neuron fires, it expends energy in the form of heat ( Squire & Lissauer 2007). This can cause a discharge in many parts of the neuron. These individual discharges then propagate down the axon and across its branches, until they reach another neuron. There, that neuron will release some substances that help to promote new firing (such as more neurotransmitters) or suppress old firings (such as less serotonin). Finally, this process repeats over and over again throughout the cell body	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Using an analogy, explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron.
An action potential is like a waveform. A waveform travels down the neuron in a straight line, because voltage levels inside the neuron are always at equilibrium. When an action potential arrives on a cell, it triggers anotherwaveform within the neuron that will travel up the neuron and create new spikes ofvoltage!	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Using an analogy, explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron.
Frogs have lungs like humans, but instead of air passing through the lungs and theoretically lifting the frog up in the process, water is circulated around them. When a frog breathes in (inhalates), they take in as much oxygenated water as they need to and use their ever-growing senescent white blood cells to produce carbon dioxide gas. The gases escape from their skin through an opening at the top of their mouth called a sinus - this helps control body temperature since warm humid air rises while cold drafts flow downward.	breathing mechanism of frogs	Using an analogy, explain breathing mechanism of frogs.
When you take a deep breath, your blood pressure increases. When the air is let out again, your heart rate goes down because it takes time for the blood to get back up to its original level.	breathing mechanism of frogs	Using an analogy, explain breathing mechanism of frogs.
Breathing is a process of exchanging air with the lungs. The frog's body creates carbon dioxide gas as it breaths and exhales, which helps to prevent build-up of toxins in the blood.	breathing mechanism of frogs	Using an analogy, explain breathing mechanism of frogs.
The frog's breathing is accomplished through the use of both blood and air. Blood flow to the frogs' lungs helps them breathe, while air enters and exits thefrogs' nose and mouth. The frog's stem also uses a number of muscle groups to help it move its body, including an eructator (the up-and-down movement of the chest), a regurgitator (the ingestion of food), as well as abdominal muscles that contract with respiration	breathing mechanism of frogs	Using an analogy, explain breathing mechanism of frogs.
Rivers and streams flow downhill, while frogs move up and down with each breath. The water in a river provides basic sustenance for amphibians, but they also need air to breathe. When an amphibian breathes in, the respiratory muscles pull oxygenated blood into their lungs from the surrounding atmosphere. These same muscles then push clean air out of their lungs as they exhale.	breathing mechanism of frogs	Using an analogy, explain breathing mechanism of frogs.
A layered architecture is an architectural design principle in which a system of interconnected levels has been constructed, each of which may be thought of as a layer. The layers are built up one above the other, with the topmost layer serving as the root or foundation, and each additional layer being added on top. This allows for growth and complexity without increasing costs or size.	layered architecture	Using an analogy, explain layered architecture.
An example of a layered architecture might be an onion, where each layer has its own functions and operations. This is because the layers are stacked one on top of the other in order to create or maintain some balance or symmetry.	layered architecture	Using an analogy, explain layered architecture.
A layer is a slice or pellet of something that covers or fills an area. Layers are sometimes put in layers, so we say "three layers of defense." This analogy shows how each layer can protect the next one.	layered architecture	Using an analogy, explain layered architecture.

The data may be spread out over many different physical locations, but it remains accessible and managed through the use of communication protocols, software programs and management tools at each level.	layered architecture	Using an analogy, explain layered architecture.
Layer by layer, the architecture is like a cake. The first layer is the base, and then add frosting on top to create different flavors and colors. Next, put something sweet in the center of each flavor so that people can really enjoy it. Finally, add some crunchy toppings to make things more interesting.	layered architecture	Using an analogy, explain layered architecture.
An analogy could be used to explain limiting reactant and excess reactant. In the gasoline example, if you were to fill a tank with extra gasoline, it would only burn for a short time before it runs out. The same is true with reactants in chemical reactions. If you have too much of one type of reactant, your reaction will not work as planned.

A limiting reactant is a material that will not start to cook or produce heat until there is an excess of it. This means that the reaction will continue forever without any end, while an excess reactant will slowly start and stop the reacted process.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Using an analogy, explain limiting reactant and excess reactant.
An analogy would be to say that limiting reactant is like controlling the temperature of a furnace. You can set it so that the furnace works at a certain setting and not let any other element get in the way, but if there's too much heat we'll overheat and lose something.

A limiting reactant is a substance that precise control over the rate at which it creates products. For example, in order for one to make gasoline from coal, they would need to limit the reactant proportions so that each molecule of coal produces only 1 gallon of gasoline. Similarly, if someone wanted to produce unlimited amounts of electricity without mentioning any other reactions (like burning oil), then they would need to avoid using limited reactants whenever possible.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Using an analogy, explain limiting reactant and excess reactant.

The captains of different boats might disagree about where they should go, but ultimately everyone gets on board and sails towards their destination.

An analogy for limiting reactant is to say that it is like a pot of water on the stove. When you put a little oil in the pot, it starts boiling and creating heat. The same thing happens with reactants - when you add them, they start by boiling and creating energy but eventually reach their maximum potential.	limiting reactant	Using an analogy, explain limiting reactant.
A limiting reactant is a substance thatatoonzes the rate at which one or more products of an reaction occur.

Analogously, when encoding messages it is important to consider the "packages" in the message. These packages can be thought of as chunks of data that are related and together form a unit. When encoding a message, these chunks need to be organized so that they can be transmitted accurately and securely.

The first picture could represent a simple idea, like an individual's name or age. The second may be more complicated and explain something even more simply, like how many students are in your class. The third might describe something bigger, such as an event that happened at school today. eachpicture needs only two pieces of information (the Mona Lisa and what day it is) to encode everything that deputies found during the investigation into Tammy Bourgeois' death on March 21st; just four pieces of data (Date: 18-Oct-2015 11:19 PM), which can then be easily translated into text format for eyewitness testimony or analysis by investigators!	message encoding	Using an analogy, explain message encoding.
