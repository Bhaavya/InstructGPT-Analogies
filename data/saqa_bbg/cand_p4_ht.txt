 DNA replication is like the act of copying a song. The first time you hear the song, your genetics tells your brain that she needs to produce this number of copies for her bandmates. So every time she sings another note, her genetics will create more copies of her genes and those copied genes will be put into new cells where they can start replicating themselves again (and potentially multiplying).	dna replication	Use an analogy to explain dna replication.
Cells divide DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) into long strands. The strand that a cell attaches to is called the chromosomal DNA. This chromosome includes all of the genes that are responsible for making proteins in the cell.	dna replication	Use an analogy to explain dna replication.
Imagine you are a scientist who is trying to study how genes are expressed in the body. You take some cells from your subject and start growing them in culture, using methods known as genetic engineering. After a while, you want to know what kinds of genes are expressed most often. To do this, you would gather data on the expression levels of all the genes in these cultures, measure their activity (using techniques like western blotting), and look at where they come together in order to see which proteins interact with each other. This is how dna replication works - by gathering data on gene expression levels and looking for interactions between proteins that could explain why particular expressions occur.	dna replication	Use an analogy to explain dna replication.
Remember the cloning process? DNA replication is like that - a series of repeats of the same instructions.	dna replication	Use an analogy to explain dna replication.

RNA transcription is like turning a knob to get music from an audio player. You need some type of input, such as air pressure or temperature, to turn the knob and then listen to the result. The same thing happens with RNA transcription: you need some type of factor (like oxygen) to turn on the enzyme (azyme), which will translate your data into mRNA.	rna transcription	Use an analogy to explain rna transcription.
 Transcripts are like recipes. You can't just eyeball them and know how they taste or what ingredients to use. You need a recipe to get started, and then you want to make alterations as you go along so that the end product tastes good. The same is true with rna transcription - you need a starting point, some basics including which nucleotides to use etc., and then you'll want to tweak things as needed until it represents your desired output.	rna transcription	Use an analogy to explain rna transcription.
There are three steps in the process of DNA transcription: the primer, where a sequence of RNA is inserted; the cistogram which shows how many times each nucleotide has been transcribed through this primer/RNA hybrid; and finally the final product which is a protein.	rna transcription	Use an analogy to explain rna transcription.
 mRNA transcription is like translating a text into speech. Transcripts come in bundles (or "gatts") of 25 to 50 peptides long and are folded into short alpha helices. Each peptide contains three bases, each of which code for one amino acid.	rna transcription	Use an analogy to explain rna transcription.
RNA transcription is like typing a text message into a computer. Each letter of the alphabet is assigned an address, and when you type in "Grunts," the software will translate that as "Grunts."

Proteintranslation is like translating a text from one language to another.	protein translation	Use an analogy to explain protein translation.
A protein translation is like a story being told by an author. Each sentence has a beginning, middle, and end. The author starts with the sentence "I saw." Then, they move on to the next paragraph where they describe what happened in between those two sentences. In translating these stories, it's important that you understand how the author moves from one idea to another kybernetically (atom-by-atom) while keeping all of their essential information moving forward unchanged.	protein translation	Use an analogy to explain protein translation.
While protein translation is a complex process, most of it happens in the cytoplasm. Protein translocation from one site to another in the cell occurs through facilitatory and repressive signaling pathways.	protein translation	Use an analogy to explain protein translation.

The Recipe for Cake will tell you how many eggs and cups of sugar are needed, but the end product won’t look any different if all those ingredients are used exactly as written.

ographing an action potential down a neuron is like drawing a diagram of the nervous system. Every time you press a key, your hand moves the stylus across the paper and makes tiny ink marks on the diagram. The movement of the stylus causes electricity to flow through the paper and these small electric current sparks cause more voltage to flow through each nerve cell in your brain. This keeps your brain active and running smoothly!	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Use an analogy to explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron.

These individuals each have their own job responsibilities and tasks that must be completed before moving on to the next panel or employee.	layered architecture	Use an analogy to explain layered architecture.
The way an onion is peeled is by breaking the skin away from one layer and then separating the edible part from the not-edible part. This process of removing layers is called an architecture. The same analogy can be used to describe how a company's structureevolves over time. At first, it might seem like there are only two types of people in the company-the CEO and workers. But as more and more people join the company, they must now be organized into different departments based on their skillsets and responsibilities. And as new technologies come into play, these departmental boundaries will change too!	layered architecture	Use an analogy to explain layered architecture.

One analogy to explain limiting reactant and excess reactant is like a pot of water that has been put on the stove.

This is how elements work in chemistry- each element has its own range of Reaction States (or Reactants) which can only be reached through specific temperature settings.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Use an analogy to explain limiting reactant and excess reactant.
An analogy would be to think of limiting reactants as a pot of water that you have to watch carefully. Once the pot's contents reach a certain level, you can no longer add more water until it returns back down to its original level - in this case, the lower limit for reactant is set by how much water was added originally and then any additional water cannot exceed that amount.Similarly, when reacting with another chemical reaction, always keep in mind what the limits are for each side were they trying to achieve their respective goals! If one end has only limited reactants (e.g., pure chloride) while the other side has an excess of reactant (chloride+H2O), they will achieve different outcomes based on whether or not they exceeded their reacted-to-end product's Limits	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Use an analogy to explain limiting reactant and excess reactant.
A swimming pool has a limitation on the number of people that can swim in at once. If you limit yourself to 3 people, you cannot swim very well.

An analogy to explain limiting reactant is like a game of musical chairs. If someone leaves their seat at the back of the room, then another person has to take their place and play when their turn comes up again.

A tree is said to be "aged" when it has reached its prime of growth.	tree's age calculation	Use an analogy to explain tree's age calculation.
A tree's age calculation is like a person's growth. A person's height and weight will change over time as they age, but their bone density and muscle mass will not. The same applies to trees; the taller they are, the less total wood there is in them, but the more seeds there are in each individual leaf or trunk (or root). The older a tree is, the more physical its features become: coniferous trees grow larger middles with fewer branches and smaller leaves; spruce-fir forests have shorter bigasts with many branching cambiums)	tree's age calculation	Use an analogy to explain tree's age calculation.

The same principle applies to trees: over time, they lose water and nutrients from the ground so they gradually become older.	tree's age calculation	Use an analogy to explain tree's age calculation.

If you build a transmitting antenna using metal sheeting and some sort of weights or stones to spreads the radiation, then you'll need to use stokes scattering.

This gives rise to interference in transmission and can cause poor reception.	stokes scattering	Use an analogy to explain stokes scattering.
