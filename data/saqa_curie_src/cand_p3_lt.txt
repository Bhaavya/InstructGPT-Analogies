Both glycolysis and a roller coaster involve a series of ups and downs. In glycolysis, the sugar is converted into two molecules of glucose. Glucose is then transported across the cell membrane and used in the cell's energy production. In a roller coaster, the car goes up a hill, then goes down a hill, and then goes up a hill again.	glycolysis	Explain how glycolysis is similar to roller coaster.
Anti-stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate because the energy of the ball is scattered in all directions.	anti-stokes scattering	Explain how anti-stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate.
Stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate because the ball is moving and the plate is stationary.	stokes scattering	Explain how stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate.
Median lethal dose is a measure of the amount of a substance that is needed to kill half of a population of a particular species. Balls and target are both methods of estimating the lethal dose of a substance.	median lethal dose	Explain how median lethal dose is similar to balls and target.
The universe is similar to the surface of a balloon in that it is a three-dimensional space. The universe is also similar to the surface of a balloon in that it is filled with gas and air. The universe is also similar to the surface of a balloon in that it is curved.	universe	Explain how universe is similar to surface of a balloon.
Enzyme mechanism is similar to lock and key because the enzyme binds to the substrate and changes the shape of the substrate so that it can no longer bind to the enzyme.	enzyme mechanism	Explain how enzyme mechanism is similar to lock and key.
Anova is a statistical method used to compare the effects of two or more treatments on a population. It is similar to the method used to find signal in the noise, which is used to identify patterns in data that may be indicative of a signal.	anova	Explain how anova is similar to finding signal in the noise.
The hypothalamus is a part of the brain that is responsible for controlling body temperature. The thermostat is a device that helps to control the temperature in a building or home.	thermostat	Explain how thermostat is similar to hypothalamus.
Chemical equilibrium is similar to water level in dam and lake because both are systems in which the concentration of a substance in a liquid or gas is constant. In a dam, the water level is kept constant by the dam's reservoir, while in a lake, the water level is kept constant by the gravitational force of the lake's water.	chemical equilibrium	Explain how chemical equilibrium is similar to water level in dam and lake.
Just-in-time is similar to water and rocks in that it is a resource that is necessary for many processes in the world. Just-in-time is also similar to water and rocks in that it is a scarce resource.	just-in-time	Explain how just-in-time is similar to water and rocks.
Adaptive immunity is similar to police headquerters in that both are methods of defending oneself from an attacker. Police headquerters are a form of self-defense where an individual uses their head to hit an attacker in the head. Adaptive immunity is a defense mechanism where the body produces antibodies to fight off a foreign invader.	adaptive immunity	Explain how adaptive immunity is similar to police headquerters.
Ohm's law is similar to cats, mice and cake because they are all physical laws that describe how electrical current flows.	ohm's law	Explain how ohm's law is similar to cats, mice and cake.
Transcription is similar to photocopying in that both processes involve copying text from one medium to another. In transcription, the text is copied from a physical document such as a book or paper, and then it is converted into digital form. In photocopying, the text is copied from one medium, such as a piece of paper, to another, such as a computer screen.	transcription	Explain how transcription is similar to photocopying.
Both rna polymerase and xerox machines use heat and pressure to create copies of a template. RNA polymerase is also able to copy RNA sequences in a similar way to DNA.	rna polymerase	Explain how rna polymerase is similar to xerox machine.
Ribosomes are similar to cooks in that they are responsible for the chemical reactions that occur in cells. Ribosomes are also similar in that they are small, protein-based molecules.	ribosome	Explain how ribosome is similar to cook.
Activator protein is similar to bookmarks in that it helps to keep track of where you are in a document.	activator protein	Explain how activator protein is similar to bookmarks.
Electric circuit is similar to air flowing through a tube in that electric current flows through the circuit. The difference is that electric current is created by the movement of electrons through a conductor, while air flows through a tube due to the pressure of the air.	electric circuit	Explain how electric circuit is similar to air flowing through a tube.
Electric circuit is similar to rope through metal rings because both have a conductor (electric wire) that goes through a series of rings (electrical components). The difference is that electric circuit has an electric current flowing through the wire while rope through metal rings does not.	electric circuit	Explain how electric circuit is similar to rope through metal rings.
Both hydrophobic and teenagers at a party are objects that are not wanted by many people. Hydrophobic objects are not wanted because they will not mix with other objects, which is the same reason teenagers at a party are not wanted.	hydrophobic effect	Explain how hydrophobic effect is similar to teenagers at a party.
Biological signal transduction is similar to threat communication in animals in that both involve the transmission of a signal from one organism to another in order to elicit a response. However, the two processes differ in several ways. For example, biological signal transduction is much more complex than threat communication, and it involves the transmission of a wide variety of signals across a variety of different cells and tissues. Threat communication, on the other hand, is typically limited to the transmission of signals that are associated with danger or threat.	biological signal transduction	Explain how biological signal transduction is similar to threat communication in animals.
