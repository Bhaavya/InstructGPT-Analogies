When a ball is struck by a bat, the ball's momentum causes it to hit the plate at an angle. This angle is determined by the ball's speed and the bat's speed. The faster the ball is moving, the greater the angle. The angle also depends on the size and shape of the ball and the plate.When the ball hits the plate, some of the energy is transferred to the plate. This energy is called anti-stokes scattering.

The closer the ball is to the center of the target, the more points it will score. The target is also divided into 10 sections, with the center section being worth the most points.If you shoot all of the balls into the lower section of the target, you will have scored the most points and won the game. If you shoot all of the balls into the upper section of the target, you will have scored the least points and lost the game. The median lethal dose is the point at which half of the balls score more points and half of the balls score less points. The median lethal dose is also the point at which the balls will score the same number of points in the lower and upper sections of the target.	median lethal dose	Explain median lethal dose using an analogy involving balls and target.

When water is added to a dam, the water level in the dam rises. This is because the water is pushing against the dam's walls, and the dam can only hold so much water. When the water level in the dam reaches its maximum, the water level in the lake also reaches its maximum. This is because the water is now spread out over a larger area, and it takes more water to fill up a lake than it does to fill up a dam.	chemical equilibrium	Explain chemical equilibrium using an analogy involving water level in dam and lake.
Just-in-time is a manufacturing process where products are produced as they are needed, rather than in bulk. This is done by having a system in place that monitors the production process and makes adjustments as needed. For example, if a rock is needed to make a product, but the rock supplier is not currently in production, the system will order the rock from the supplier as needed. This way, the production process is always moving forward and the products are always fresh.	just-in-time	Explain just-in-time using an analogy involving water and rocks.
Imagine that you are a police officer on patrol. You see a group of people walking down the street. You stop them and ask for their identification. They give you their IDs, and you see that they are all adults. You then ask them to show you their driver's licenses. All of the adults show you their driver's licenses, but one of the adults has a different ID. You ask the adult what the ID is, and the adult tells you that it is a driver's license from a state that doesn't exist. You then ask the adult to show you the license, and the adult can't. You then arrest the adult for possessing a fake ID.	adaptive immunity	Explain adaptive immunity using an analogy involving police headquerters.
Ohm's law can be thought of as the law of electricity. It states that the voltage (or electrical potential) across a conductor (in this case, a wire) is proportional to the current flowing through it. In other words, the more current flowing through a wire, the higher the voltage. This is analogous to how the amount of electricity flowing through a cat's fur is proportional to the cat's activity. The more active the cat, the more electricity is flowing through its fur. The same is true for mice and cake. The more cake a mouse eats, the more electricity is flowing through its fur. And the more electricity is flowing through the wire, the higher the voltage.	ohm's law	Explain ohm's law using an analogy involving cats, mice and cake.
