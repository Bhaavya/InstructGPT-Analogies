When you are climbing a staircase, your body is using energy to move upward. The same thing happens when you are using electricity: electrons flow through wires and create an electric current.	voltage	Explain how voltage is similar to climbing a staircase.
When climbing a staircase, your muscles work harder and faster than when you're just going up or coming down a stair. This is because the stairs are an increase in height, while walking around is basically constant level ground. The same thing happens with voltage; an increase (voltage) means more effort to move the current through the circuit.	voltage	Explain how voltage is similar to climbing a staircase.
When you climb a staircase, your muscles use energy to lift your body upward. The same thing happens when you change the voltage in an electric circuit: Some of the electrons move from one atom or molecule to another, and this produces electricity.	voltage	Explain how voltage is similar to climbing a staircase.
Both voltage and climbing a staircase involve going up an incline. Voltage is measured in volts, while the height of a staircase is measured in steps. When you step on the bottom stair of a staircase, your foot presses down on one tread and lifts up the next one. This creates a decrease in air pressure under yourfoot and forces electrons through the metal stairs downward (see Physics for more information about electrostatic fields). Your toe exerts more force than your heel because it has more contact with each stair - this difference is called "the coefficient of friction." The higher number corresponds to harder surfaces like ice or rocks, while lower numbers correspond to softer surfaces like rubber.	voltage	Explain how voltage is similar to climbing a staircase.
A staircase is a good analogy for voltage because they both have a gradual increase in height. Voltage also has an even flow which means that the voltage will remain consistent up to a certain point. Lastly, like stairs, you can use handrails or rails to help guide your way and keep yourself from falling.	voltage	Explain how voltage is similar to climbing a staircase.
In football, teams are specialized in different areas of the game. For example, one team might specialize in passing while another specializes in running the ball.

Nature of a density wave is similar to traffic jam on a highway. When there are more cars than lanes available, the drivers will pile up and create a traffic jam. Similarly, when there are more people in an area than space available, they will form into dense masses and cause congestion.	nature of a density wave	Explain how nature of a density wave is similar to traffic jam on a highway.
When traffic congestion occurs on a highway, vehicles are unable to move forward or backwards because of the large number of cars in close proximity to one another. In the same way, when density waves occur in water, they create an obstruction that causes less dense water to rise while more dense water stays below. This imbalance creates turbulence and makes it difficult for objects to move through the wave	nature of a density wave	Explain how nature of a density wave is similar to traffic jam on a highway.
A density wave is a type of traffic jam on a highway. Traffic jams can happen when there is too much traffic on the road. The cars are all trying to move along, but they are all stuck in the same spot because there isn't enough space for everyone.	nature of a density wave	Explain how nature of a density wave is similar to traffic jam on a highway.
A density wave is similar to a traffic jam on the highway because both phenomena are caused by high traffic volume. In a density wave, the high traffic volume causes vehicles to bunch up together and slow down. Similarly, in a traffic jam, the high traffic volume causes cars to line up bumper-to-bumper.	nature of a density wave	Explain how nature of a density wave is similar to traffic jam on a highway.

A rate-determining step in a chemical reaction is similar to buying stamps at the post office. In both cases, there is a long line of customers and each individual has to wait their turn. The difference between these two situations is that when you buy stamps, you know how many stamps you will need and can plan your purchases accordingly. In contrast, during a chemical reaction, it is not always clear how many molecules of one reactant will interact with molecules of another reactant to produce a product. This unpredictability results in uncertainty about how muchproduct will be produced and leads to waiting in line for an indefinite period of time.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Explain how rate-determining step of a reaction is similar to buying stamps at the post office, when there is a long line of customers.
In both cases there is a waiting process in which customers line up. In the case of buying stamps, each customer must wait in line and then place the stamp into the envelope they are mailing. The same thing happens with chemical reactions - each molecule needs to be placed on its own special step of the reaction vessel before it can take part in catalysis.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Explain how rate-determining step of a reaction is similar to buying stamps at the post office, when there is a long line of customers.
The rate-determining step of a reaction is similar to buying stamps at the post office, when there is a long line of customers. In both situations, someone has to wait in line and decide how much money they want to spend. This person then needs to find an item that they want (stamps in this case) and figure out how many stamps they need. They can either buy them individually or get a pack of them. After getting their stamps, the person needs to go up to the counter and pay for them.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Explain how rate-determining step of a reaction is similar to buying stamps at the post office, when there is a long line of customers.

Both vehicles are moving at the same speed, but the rate-determining step in a reaction is faster than the slowest moving car in traffic. The rate-determining step is when one molecule of molecules react to form a new product.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Explain how rate-determining step of a reaction is similar to slowest moving car in traffic.
The rate-determining step of a reaction is like the slowest moving car in traffic. The slowest moving car in traffic can avoid getting stuck in traffic, but it will never move as fast as the cars that are moving faster. Similarly, the rate-determining step of a reaction can avoid taking too long, but it will always take longer than reactions that proceed quickly through this step.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Explain how rate-determining step of a reaction is similar to slowest moving car in traffic.
Both the rate-determining step and the slowest moving car in traffic are involved in a process that is ultimately responsible for an increase or decrease in entropy.

And, as with all processes where entropy changes occur, it's important to understand why this change happens.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Explain how rate-determining step of a reaction is similar to slowest moving car in traffic.
The rate-determining step in a reaction is similar to the slowest moving car in traffic. The rate-determining step is the step that determines how fast a reaction will proceed. Thisstep usually involves molecules of reactants coming together to form products. If there are too many barriers stoppingthe molecules from coming together quickly enough, then the reaction won't take place atall and will instead result in an equilibrium state where bothreactant and product levels are equal.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Explain how rate-determining step of a reaction is similar to slowest moving car in traffic.
Rate-determining step of a reaction is similar to slowest moving car in traffic. The rate-determining step is the firststep in a reaction where atoms or molecules move from one reactantto another.

Column chromatography is similar to separating bees and wasps in that both techniques use a stationary phase (the column) to trap the different molecules of interest. However, there are some key differences between column chromatography and separation of insects: First, whereas rods or fibers are used for insect separation, columns typically consist of silica particles; second, most modern columns are equipped with programs that automatically adjust the composition of the adsorbent Matrix according to the mass spectrometer output; and finally, while insect cells can be ruptured and their contents defused within seconds, most commercial laboratory columns must withstand temperatures up to 350°C.	column chromatography	Explain how column chromatography is similar to separating bees and wasps.
Column chromatography separates substances by their size and/or polarity. Bees and wasps are both small, so they travel through the column faster than larger substances. Polarity is also a factor; bees have a positive charge while wasps have a negative charge. This causes different molecules to move along the column in different directions.	column chromatography	Explain how column chromatography is similar to separating bees and wasps.
Column chromatography is a similar separation technique to separating bees and wasps, in that column chromatography utilizes chiral columns to isolate different chemical compounds. In both cases, the difference is that while bee colonies are composed of numerous workers who can separate chemicals using their sense of smell, wasps use their antennae to detect polarized light (vibrations in the air caused by particles moving through it).	column chromatography	Explain how column chromatography is similar to separating bees and wasps.
Column chromatography is similar to separating bees and wasps because both methods involve using a stationary phase, which in column chromatography is a porous material that allows molecules of different sizes to pass through it. In the case of separating bees and wasps, the stationary phase is a gel matrix made up of small particles called polysaccharides. Molecules larger than the polysaccharide size are forced out of the column while smaller molecules can pass through.	column chromatography	Explain how column chromatography is similar to separating bees and wasps.

Dynamic chemical equilibrium is similar to two jugglers. In both cases, the two individuals are balancing precariously on a tightrope – one step can cause them to fall off and lose their balance completely. The two jugglers must constantly adjust their movements in order to stay balanced and keep each other alive. Similarly, in dynamic chemical equilibrium, atoms and molecules are constantly moving around as they attempt to find the most stable arrangement. If either of these Juggler's were to make even minor mistakes, they could easily be thrown off their balance and would lose control over their chemistry entirely	dynamic chemical equilibrium	Explain how dynamic chemical equilibrium is similar to two jugglers.

Oncogenes are similar to a car accelerator stuck in the down position. If you have a car with an automatic transaxle, when you put your foot on the brake pedal, the transmission shifts into park and holds that gear until you take your foot off the pedal. The same thing happens with an oncogene – once it's activated, it keeps driving cancer cells along indefinitely.	oncogenes	Explain how oncogenes is similar to car accelerator stuck in down position.
Oncogenes are proteins that can cause tumors to grow. Car accelerator stuck in down position is also a protein, but it doesn't cause tumors to grow.	oncogenes	Explain how oncogenes is similar to car accelerator stuck in down position.

Tumor suppressor genes are similar to car brakes in that they work together to keep a vehicle from crashing. Car brakes stop the car by applying pressure to the brake discs. Tumor suppressor genes help cells avoid growing out of control, which can lead to cancer.	tumor suppressor genes	Explain how tumor suppressor genes is similar to car brakes.
In both cases, the system is designed to stop something from happening. For car brakes, this means stopping a car quickly; for tumor suppressor genes, it means stopping cells from growing out of control.	tumor suppressor genes	Explain how tumor suppressor genes is similar to car brakes.
The brakes on a car work by slowing down or stopping the vehicle. Tumor suppressor genes do exactly the same thing in cancer cells - they help to keep these cells from growing and spreading.	tumor suppressor genes	Explain how tumor suppressor genes is similar to car brakes.
Tumor suppressor genes are similar to car brakes because both work to stop something from happening. Car brakes work by hitting the brake pedal, which makes the car slow down. Tumor suppressor genes work in a similar way: they help keep tumor cells from growing and spreading.	tumor suppressor genes	Explain how tumor suppressor genes is similar to car brakes.
Tumor suppressor genes function like car brakes, stopping tumors from growing. Tumors take advantage of oncogene mutations ( alterations in the normal genetic code that can spur cancer) to grow and spread. Mutants with oncogene mutations usually have a higher rate of tumor growth and survival than those without these changes. Some tumor suppressor genes help stop this abnormal process by repairing or inhibiting mutant cells. Like car brakes, when these brake mechanisms are not working properly—either because of damage or a lack of activation—tumors can get away and cause harm to nearby tissues	tumor suppressor genes	Explain how tumor suppressor genes is similar to car brakes.

Brittle software is similar to jenga in the sense that they are both pieces of data-heavy, interactive systems where a small change can cause large consequences. Jenga is a game where players build towers of blocks using only their hands and then try to pull them down one by one; if any block falls off the tower it starts a chain reaction that causes the entire tower to collapse. Brittle software works similarly: if just one part of the system breaks, all sorts of havoc can ensue as other parts fail orittenly because they relied on data from the broken piece.	brittle software	Explain how brittle software is similar to jenga.
Both software and jenga are made up of many small pieces that can easily be broken if not handled carefully. When a piece is inserted incorrectly, or when something else falls on top of it, it can quickly fall apart. Brittle software also often has weak points where important data resides, making it vulnerable to attack. In the case of jenga, if one block is removed from the stack without being placed properly, the entire tower will come tumbling down	brittle software	Explain how brittle software is similar to jenga.
Both brittle software and jenga are pieces of furniture that can be easily damaged or destroyed if they are not carefully constructed.

Wave mechanical model and firefly are both examples of a sighting phenomenon. In a dark room, the eye will take longer to adjust to darkness than it will to light, so objects that are brightly lit at first will become less visible as the eyes get used to the darker environment. This is also what happens with waves; when you view them from close up they may seem smooth, but if you observe them from a distance they might appear Rutted or even disorderly.	wave mechanical model	Explain how wave mechanical model is similar to firefly in a dark room.
Wave mechanical model is similar to firefly in a dark room because both of them use the light from stars and other sources to navigate.	wave mechanical model	Explain how wave mechanical model is similar to firefly in a dark room.
Both wave mechanical model and firefly use fly signals to navigate. Wave mechanical model uses a head-on collision to navigate, while Firefly uses the light from its pilot's eyes as a guide.	wave mechanical model	Explain how wave mechanical model is similar to firefly in a dark room.
The wave mechanical model is similar to the firefly in a dark room because they are both sensitive to light.	wave mechanical model	Explain how wave mechanical model is similar to firefly in a dark room.
Both models are used to study the movement of objects in a dark room. In wave mechanical model, an object moves along a series of waves. This is similar to how fireflies move around in a dark room.	wave mechanical model	Explain how wave mechanical model is similar to firefly in a dark room.
Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test that measures the electrical activity of the brain. EEG is similar to listening to a game because it gives scientists an idea of how our brains are working.	electroencephalogram	Explain how electroencephalogram is similar to listening to a game.
Electroencephalogram is similar to listening to a game because they both involve electrodes that are placed on the head in order to record electrical activity.	electroencephalogram	Explain how electroencephalogram is similar to listening to a game.
Both electroencephalogram and listening to a game involve the brain processing information. Electroencephalogram records electrical activity in the brain, while listening to a game involves detecting changes in sound frequency levels as users interact with the game.	electroencephalogram	Explain how electroencephalogram is similar to listening to a game.
Both electroencephalogram and listening to a game involve receiving sensory input from the environment. Electroencephalography records electrical activity in the brain, while gaming monitors movements of digital objects on a screen.	electroencephalogram	Explain how electroencephalogram is similar to listening to a game.
Both electroencephalogram and listening to a game produce patterns of electrical activity in the brain. Electroencephalography measures these patterns over time, while games allow players to control aspects of the game environment in order to optimize their experience.	electroencephalogram	Explain how electroencephalogram is similar to listening to a game.
Both the photocopier machine and dna replication work by copying a piece of text or an image from one surface to another. The photocopier uses light to create an image on a sheet of paper, while DNA replication uses genetic material to copy strands of nucleotides together.	dna replication	Explain how dna replication is similar to photocopier machine.
Both dna replication and photocopier machines use light energy to create physical copies of documents. Dna replication uses the Genetic Code, or genes as a template for copying strands of DNA into new cells. Photocopiers work by shining a bright light on original document and then using mirrors to direct the image onto photographic film which is then developed into an image that can be printed out.	dna replication	Explain how dna replication is similar to photocopier machine.
DNA replication is similar to photocopier machine in that both require a light and an electron beam to copy the genetic code.	dna replication	Explain how dna replication is similar to photocopier machine.
Both replication processes involve copying one item to another. In a photocopier machine, the toner is transferred from the original sheet of paper onto the new sheet of paper. Dna replication occurs when cells divide and create copies of their DNA.	dna replication	Explain how dna replication is similar to photocopier machine.
Dna replication is similar to a photocopier machine in that both are devices used for copying digital data. Dna replication is also similar in that it can copy adjacent sections of DNA molecule, as well as entire molecules. The main difference between dna replication and photocopying is that with photocopying, the original image or document remains unchanged while with dna replication, new copies of the same molecule are created (see diagram below).	dna replication	Explain how dna replication is similar to photocopier machine.
Dna replication is similar to book printing in that both processes involve the production of physical objects from digital information. In book printing, letters and images are placed on large sheets of paper and then transferred to small copies through a press. In dna replication, genetic instructions are copied between cells using DNA polymerase enzymes.	dna replication	Explain how dna replication is similar to book printing.
DNA replication is similar to book printing in that both processes involve copying an original text or image onto multiple copies. In DNA replication, the copy process begins with a single molecule of DNA called a template strand. The template strand is copied using the enzyme polymerase III, which results in two new identical strands of DNA. Then, the two new strands are joined together by another enzyme called helicase to form a single duplex and begin replicating. As each division process occurs, one half of the duplex will become shorter while the other half becomes longer. This alternating pattern produces four daughter molecules (three if you omit one replication step). Eventually, all four daughter molecules will have replicated themselves and formed twelve copies of the original template strand	dna replication	Explain how dna replication is similar to book printing.
DNA replication is similar to book printing in that each new DNA strand is created by copying the information from one of the original strands. In both cases, individual pieces of information are copied and combined together to create a new structure.	dna replication	Explain how dna replication is similar to book printing.
The process of book printing is similar to the replication of DNA. The two processes involve using an inkjet printer to print text and images onto paper. In both cases, a template or master copy is used to create multiple copies that are then distributed to individual printers around the globe.	dna replication	Explain how dna replication is similar to book printing.
DNA replication is similar to book printing in that both processes involve the copying of text and images from one medium into another. In DNA replication, genetic material is copied between two cells so that each cell has an identical copy of the entire genome. Book printing involves the duplication of individual sheets of paper to create multiple copies of a document.	dna replication	Explain how dna replication is similar to book printing.
Both RNA transcription and language translation involve the reading of an input text and the production of a corresponding output text. However, there are some key differences between these two processes. For example, in transcription, single-stranded nucleic acids are transcribed into complementary strands of double-stranded DNA which then become active genes. In contrast, during translation, one original language text is converted into another through the use of rules that govern how words relate to each other.	rna transcription	Explain how rna transcription is similar to language translation.
Rna transcription is a process of converting DNA into mRNA, which can then be translated into proteins. The main similarity between rna transcription and language translation is that both processes involve the conversion of complex information sources (DNA in the case of rna transcription, words in the case of language translation) into simpler pieces ready for use by the body.	rna transcription	Explain how rna transcription is similar to language translation.
Both translation and transcription rely on the use of an intermediary step, in which one language is transformed into another. In translation, this intermediary step is called interpretation; in transcription, it's called encoding. Both translation and transcription are complex processes that involve a great deal of human judgment. Translation also requires familiarity with both the source language and the target language, while transcription simply involves reproducing what was said aloud or written down.	rna transcription	Explain how rna transcription is similar to language translation.
Both rna transcription and language translation involve breaking down a piece of information (in this case, an mRNA transcript) into its component pieces so that the information can be communicated to another organism. However, there are some important differences between the two processes. First, in rna transcription, the information is broken down into base pairs (two nucleotides joined together), while in language translation it is usually translated into words. Second, rna transcription occurs within cells while language translation takes place between speakers and listeners/readers.	rna transcription	Explain how rna transcription is similar to language translation.
Rna transcription is a similar process to language translation in that it involves breaking down a complex sequence of nucleotides into smaller units called "codons" and then translating the codon sequences into corresponding mRNA transcripts. However, while language translation relies on human or machine-produced dictionaries to ensure accurate translations, rna transcription is largely automated and relies on well-established genetic rules governing how different nucleotide codes form strings of letters that can be translated back into protein molecules.	rna transcription	Explain how rna transcription is similar to language translation.
Protein translation is similar to language translation in that both rely on the use of certain rules or codes to convert one form of communication into another. Language translations are typically done by professional translators who have undergone specific training, while protein translations occur during the natural process of cell growth and development. In both cases, a translator must be familiar with the relevant code or rule set in order to accurately render one language into another.	protein translation	Explain how protein translation is similar to language translation.
Both protein translation and language translation are processes that involve the transfer of information from one location in a molecule to another. In language translation, the source text is usually in one language and the target text is usually in another. However, protein translation also takes place between proteins. Proteins serve as the basic building blocks of cells, so it makes sense that they would be targeted by translators working on this type of mission. Translation begins with identifying which specific amino acids make up a particular piece of protein code, then pairing those amino acids up according to their codons (the genetic instructions). Once these pairs have been formed, they are sent off into the cytoplasm where they will be interpreted by enzymes called peptide synthetases. If everything goes according to plan, these enzyme catalyses will result in the production of new pieces of polypeptide chain that mirror or match up with corresponding sequences contained within the mRNA transcript obtained from the original source text	protein translation	Explain how protein translation is similar to language translation.
The two processes are similar in that both involve translating pieces of text from one language to another. In protein translation, the text is the sequence of amino acids in a protein, while in language translation, the text is words. Both processes require interpretation on part of the translator and must take into account all relevant context when making their decisions.	protein translation	Explain how protein translation is similar to language translation.
Protein translation is similar to language translation in the way that both involve the decoding of a set of symbols into a meaningful phrase or sentence. However, there are some important differences between protein and language translations. For example, while language translations can be adjusted to fit different dialects, protein translations are typically based on one specific codon sequence. Additionally, because proteins are made up of amino acids rather than letters, they require a more intricate process for transcription and translation than simple text.	protein translation	Explain how protein translation is similar to language translation.
Protein translation is similar to language translation in that both require an input and output of text. In protein translation, the input text is a set of amino acids and the output text is a functional protein. Like in language translations, there are many different factors that can affect how well a translated piece of text will translate, including cultural context, idioms, and syntax. However, while linguistic translations are generally less accurate than their original counterparts due to these complexities, protein translations can be considerably inaccurate as well due to differences between proteins and amino acids.	protein translation	Explain how protein translation is similar to language translation.
ECOSystems and cities are both made up of many different organisms working together in a cooperative way to produce outputs that benefit the overall system. Cities have larger populations, which requires more resources to support than ecosystems. Cities also rely on inputs from outside sources such as industry and agriculture, while ecosystems can generate their own food and materials. But despite these differences, both city systems and ecological systems share common goals: providing shelter for humans, producing goods and services for citizens, regulating climate/weather patterns, etc.	ecosystem	Explain how ecosystem is similar to cities.
Both ecosystems and cities have many of the same features. Cities are often built in an area with a lot of people, which makes it difficult for nature to take over. Ecosystems also have many similar features, such as having different types of plants and animals.	ecosystem	Explain how ecosystem is similar to cities.
Ecosystems and cities are both complex systems that have many components working together to produce a desired outcome. Both ecosystems and cities use resources to create products or services, and both can suffer from problems if those resources are not used efficiently. Ecosystems are also able to exchange information with each other, which is useful for regulating their overall function.	ecosystem	Explain how ecosystem is similar to cities.
An ecosystem is similar to a city in that both are complex systems with many components. Ecosystems, however, have a greater diversity and number of components than cities do. Additionally, ecosystems are dynamic; they constantly interact with their surroundings to create new structures and functions.	ecosystem	Explain how ecosystem is similar to cities.
Both ecosystems and cities are composed of different species in close proximity to one another. Cities also tend to have more complex systems than ecosystems. For example, a city's transport system might be more complex than an ecosystem's food chain.	ecosystem	Explain how ecosystem is similar to cities.
The action potential propagates down a neuron by way of an electrical current. Each domino falls in the same manner - first one foot, then the next, and so on until it topples over. The sequence of events that lead to the toppling over is very similar to how an action potential travels down a neuron. First, there is a tiny change in voltage across one of the neurons' membranes as ions start flowing more freely than before (this process is known as depolarization). This initial increase in voltage causes other nearby cells to become more active as well, leading to an even greater surge of activity and soon enough you have a cascade effect spreading throughout the entire network like dominos falling	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain how propagation of an action potential down a neuron is similar to falling dominoes.
The propagation of an action potential down a neuron is similar to falling dominoes. A domino will fall if the first domino falls on it, and because neurons are like electrical circuits, when an action potential travels down a neuron, it causes other nearby cells to fire as well.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain how propagation of an action potential down a neuron is similar to falling dominoes.
When an action potential travels down a neuron, it behaves like a falling domino. The initial action potential causes the next one to fire more easily. This chain reaction continues until the neuron dies or the action potential gets blocked by something else.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain how propagation of an action potential down a neuron is similar to falling dominoes.
When an action potential is propagated down a neuron, the tendrils that comprise it resemble falling dominoes. Each of these tendrils consists of a group of cells that are electrically connected to one another. When the Action potential reaches the bottommost cell in the chain, it causes this cell to release an electrical discharge which travels up the chain and into adjacent cells. This process continues until finally all of the cells in the chain have discharged and sent an electric current throughout their respective tissues	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain how propagation of an action potential down a neuron is similar to falling dominoes.
Both actions potentials and dominoes are initiated by an external stimulus, such as falling rocks or a person's step. In both cases the outward energy bursts cause tiny changes in the surrounding molecules that set off further bursts of energy until something reaches bottom (action potential) or topples over (domino).	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain how propagation of an action potential down a neuron is similar to falling dominoes.
The frog's breathing mechanism is very similar to that of a balloon. When the frog inhales, its ribcage expands and draws in air through its mouth and nose. This air is then forced into and up through the throat, where it is processed by the lungs. The oxygen-rich air then travels down the windpipe and out of the lungs	breathing mechanism of frogs	Explain how breathing mechanism of frogs is similar to blowing of the balloon.
The frog's breathing mechanism is similar to the way that a balloon blows. When you blow a balloon, the air pressure inside of it gets higher and higher until it becomes too much and the balloon bursts. The same thing happens with frogs when they breathe. Their lungs are filled with air, and as they take in a breath, the air pressure in their lungs gets really high. But just like with balloons, when the air pressure gets too high, their lungs can't hold any more oxygen so they start to pour out gas bubbles.	breathing mechanism of frogs	Explain how breathing mechanism of frogs is similar to blowing of the balloon.
Breathing of frogs is similar to blowing of the balloon. The only difference is that the frog's lungs are not divided into small chambers like human lungs, but they are connected directly to its stomach. This way, when gas exchange takes place in between these organs and the atmosphere, it occurs very quickly and effectively.	breathing mechanism of frogs	Explain how breathing mechanism of frogs is similar to blowing of the balloon.
Breathing of frogs is similar to blowing of the balloon in that both involve inhalation and exhalation. The main difference between frog breathing and blowing a balloon is that when you blow a balloon, air pressure inside the balloon increases until it bursts; while with frogs, breath enters and leaves their body through separate openings (the mouth and ears), so there is no increase in air pressure.	breathing mechanism of frogs	Explain how breathing mechanism of frogs is similar to blowing of the balloon.
Both frogs and balloons use air to inflate. When you blow up a balloon, the breath of the person blowing it inflates the balloon with atmospheric pressure. This higher pressure outside forces the descending gas inside the balloon back up into your lungs where it is exhaled (see diagram below). Frogs do this too, but they have a few extra steps: their mouths are wide open so more of their body can breathe in at once; when they inhale, they push air out through their mouth and down their throat; and finally, when they exhale they close off that part of their respiratory system which allowed all that air to escape	breathing mechanism of frogs	Explain how breathing mechanism of frogs is similar to blowing of the balloon.
Layered architecture and communication with translators both involve different parts of the system talking to one another. Layered architecture separates systems into layers, each of which does a specific task. The bottom layer handles user input and interaction; the middle layer contains all of the application logic; and the topmost layer houses the presentation or interface elements. In communication, too, there are different levels at which messages travel: from lower-level processes to higher-level ones. And just like in layered architecture, each level has its own set of responsibilities and constraints.	layered architecture	Explain how layered architecture is similar to communication with translators.
Layered architecture and communication with translators are similar in that they both involve a series of layers. In layered architecture, each layer performs a specific task. The bottom layer handles the actual programming tasks, while the top layers provide support for the bottom layer by providing graphical user interfaces (GUIs), error handling, and other features. With translation, similarly, each translator typically translates one or more language varieties into another language variety. This can be done using either a word-for-word translation process or an automated machine translation process.	layered architecture	Explain how layered architecture is similar to communication with translators.
Both layered architecture and communication with translators use a series of discrete layers. Layers in the latter case are typically responsible for translating between different languages, while layers in the former case often handle different aspects of an application. In both cases, it is important to ensure that messages passing through each layer are properly formatted and interpreted.	layered architecture	Explain how layered architecture is similar to communication with translators.
The process of translating a document from one language to another can be compared to the architecture of a computer, which has many layers. Layered architecture is similar in that it allows for different parts of the system to work together properly. In the case of Translation, each layer performs specific functions and helps ensure that all communication between systems is carried out smoothly and accurately.	layered architecture	Explain how layered architecture is similar to communication with translators.
Layered architecture and communication with translators are similar in that both involve a series of steps or stages. In layered architecture, each layer performs a specific task; for example, the presentation layer renders HTML pages to be viewed by users. Similarly, when speaking with a translator, you would first speak your native language (the bottom layer), and then use a translator (a middle layer) to interpret and produce the desired translation (the top layer).	layered architecture	Explain how layered architecture is similar to communication with translators.
Both reactants are limited in quantity. In the chocolate distribution example, the amount of cocoa powder that can be used is also limited.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain how limiting reactant and excess reactant is similar to chocolate distribution.
When you bake a chocolate cake, the ingredients are combined and baked until a golden brown. The end result is that there will be some areas of the cake that are darker than others because of the cocoa powder used. This is similar to how limiting reactant works in chemistry - when two substances are combined, there will be areas where they react more intensely than other parts of the mixture.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain how limiting reactant and excess reactant is similar to chocolate distribution.
Reactants are similar to chocolate distribution in that reactants can be found concentrated in one area or dispersed throughout the reaction mixture. Reactants also have a limited supply and when used up, reactions will not proceed as planned.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain how limiting reactant and excess reactant is similar to chocolate distribution.
Reactants and excess reactants are similar to chocolate distribution in that they both involve a limited supply of something being distributed among many people. In the case of reactants, the limited supply is hydrogen gas; in the case of chocolate, it's cocoa beans.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain how limiting reactant and excess reactant is similar to chocolate distribution.
Two substances with different masses are placed in a container. If the mass of the reactant is greater than the mass of the excess reactant, then there will be an increase in pressure inside the container because more gas molecules are trying to occupy space. This is analogous to how chocolate behaves on a grater - more finely grated chocolate will tend to flow towards smaller pieces of chocolate that have less sugar granules, since sugar is a limiting reactant (it's not able to hold as many gas atoms).	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain how limiting reactant and excess reactant is similar to chocolate distribution.
Both cells and working offices are organized into structures called microtubules. Eukaryotic cells have one or more centrosomes at their center, while the microtubules in working offices are arranged in a ladderlike pattern.	eukaryotic cell	Explain how eukaryotic cell is similar to working office.
Both eukaryotic cells and working offices are composed of individual units that work together to perform a particular task. Eukaryotic cells contain organelles, such as the nucleus and mitochondria, which coordinately carry out their functions. Office workers typically interact with other office workers through communication tools like phones or computers.	eukaryotic cell	Explain how eukaryotic cell is similar to working office.
A working office is similar in many respects to an eukaryotic cell. Both are composed of a series of cells linked together by cytoplasmic connections. The main difference between an office and a cell is that the office typically has more automated functions, while the cell performs more complex metabolic tasks necessary for its survival.	eukaryotic cell	Explain how eukaryotic cell is similar to working office.
An eukaryotic cell is similar to a working office in that both have cells that carry out the basic functions of their organization. In an office, these cells are usually located within individual buildings or parcels of land, while in a typical eukaryotic cell all the different types of cells are co-located inside one large cell.	eukaryotic cell	Explain how eukaryotic cell is similar to working office.
Both eukaryotic cells and office workers have a central nervous system that controls the activities of the different parts of the body. Office workers also have a circulatory system to carry nutrients and oxygen to all parts of the body, and a sewage system to remove waste products. Finally, both office workers and eukaryotic cells have muscles that allow them to move around.	eukaryotic cell	Explain how eukaryotic cell is similar to working office.
Both prokaryotic cells and self-started businesses exist in a market economy. Prokaryotic cells produce their own proteins and other molecules, while self-started businesses include products or services that are created by the entrepreneur themselves. Both entities need to find ways to compete with others in order to survive.	prokaryotic cell	Explain how prokaryotic cell is similar to self started business.
In both cases, there is an entity that initiates the activity. In a prokaryotic cell, this is the ribosome. In a self-started business, it might be the founder or CEO. The activities of these entities are directed by genetic instructions transmitted from parent to offspring. There may also be some initial capital investment (in either case) and ongoing costs associated with running the enterprise (such as salaries for employees). However, at its heart, a prokaryotic cell and a self-started business are both driven by autonomous agents that seek to achieve objectives under conditions of uncertainty and competition.	prokaryotic cell	Explain how prokaryotic cell is similar to self started business.
A prokaryotic cell is similar to a self-started business in that it relies on energy sources and organic molecules to function. Prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus, so they cannot store genetic information the way eukaryotic cells do. Instead, DNA is packaged within RNA molecules which are then translated into proteins by ribosomes.	prokaryotic cell	Explain how prokaryotic cell is similar to self started business.
A prokaryotic cell is similar to a self-started business in that the cell must find and use resources it cannot produce on its own, such as nutrients or energy. The cell also has an "organism" (a group of cells working together) that performs specific functions, much like a company's owners, managers, and employees.	prokaryotic cell	Explain how prokaryotic cell is similar to self started business.
Both prokaryotic cells and self-started businesses are made up of a nucleus (the center part of the cell) and other organelles. The DNA in a prokaryotic cell is confined within these organelles, just as the information for a self-started business is concentrated in its owners' minds. Prokaryotes can use energy to move around their environments, while self-started businesses need resources to generate profits. Finally, both organisms must take advantage of opportunities that arise in order to survive and grow.	prokaryotic cell	Explain how prokaryotic cell is similar to self started business.
Both the kernel and a college library are important resources that provide information, support services, and storage for items such as books, journals, newspapers, pamphlets, and other materials. Both also play an important role in providing access to these materials to users who need them. The kernel helps manage computer systems while the library provides a place where people can go to find information they need.	operating systems kernel	Explain how operating systems kernel is similar to college library.
A college library has a centralized collection of books, journals, and other materials. The operating system kernel is similar in that it contains all the basic functions for managing the computer's resources. It provides an interface to hardware devices, manages file access, and coordinates software activity on the computer.	operating systems kernel	Explain how operating systems kernel is similar to college library.
Operating systems kernel is similar to college library in that it houses several different programs and libraries which help the computer system operate properly. Both collections of programs and data are maintained by a single entity, usually a university or corporation, in order to make access available to as many people as possible.	operating systems kernel	Explain how operating systems kernel is similar to college library.
Both are sources of information and both support a variety of activities. A library offers access to books, periodicals, films, and other media. Likewise, the kernel provides access to system resources such as memory, storage devices, and networks. Furthermore, libraries typically offer instruction in various subjects while the kernel supports a wide range of operating systems configurations for different types of computers.	operating systems kernel	Explain how operating systems kernel is similar to college library.
Operating systems kernels are similar to college libraries in that they contain a vast amount of information and provide access to it for users. College libraries also have an extensive collection of books, magazines, newspapers, and other materials that students can use while studying.	operating systems kernel	Explain how operating systems kernel is similar to college library.

Reactants are the granules found in coffee. They react with other substances to create a new substance. In this case, reactants limit the amount of product that can be created from them.	limiting reactant	Explain how limiting reactant is similar to a cup of coffee granules.
A reactant is similar to coffee granules in that they both limit the reaction. Both substances are small and can easily be consumed, so they help to keep things under control.	limiting reactant	Explain how limiting reactant is similar to a cup of coffee granules.
A limiting reactant is something that can be used in limited amounts. Like coffee granules, it is a small and simple molecule that has a large effect.	limiting reactant	Explain how limiting reactant is similar to a cup of coffee granules.
A cup of coffee granules is a very limiting reactant because it only allows for a certain volume to be filled with gas and liquid. In the same way, when there are too few reactants available to create a reaction, the resulting product will have little or no activity.	limiting reactant	Explain how limiting reactant is similar to a cup of coffee granules.
A reactant is similar to an engine insofar as they both need a source of energy in order to function.

Reactant is similar to an engine in that it helps the process of combustion take place. In engines, reactants are substances that are burned in order to create energy that can be used to power machinery.	limiting reactant	Explain how limiting reactant is similar to engine.
Reactant is similar to an engine in that it powers a reaction. Reactants are the small molecules necessary for a chemical reaction to take place. Engines convert these reactants into products, which then provide energy needed by the cells in our body.	limiting reactant	Explain how limiting reactant is similar to engine.
Helicase is similar to the zipper, in that it creates a series of small openings by moving along one direction. However, helicase moves much more quickly than a zipper and can cut through almost any kind of material.	helicase	Explain how helicase is similar to zipper zip.
Both enzymes catalyze the sequential removal of single DNA strands from a double-stranded molecule. However, helicases have an additional feature - they can travel along both DNA strands at the same time. Zippers, in contrast, only move along one strand at a time.	helicase	Explain how helicase is similar to zipper zip.
Similar but not the same. Helicalase is a type of enzyme that helps DNA coil up into coils. Zipper zip is an invention used to fasten two pieces of fabric together by pulling one end through the other.	helicase	Explain how helicase is similar to zipper zip.
Helicase is similar to a zipper in that it both move along the length of an object by shearing. A zipper moves up and down, while helicase moves left to right.	helicase	Explain how helicase is similar to zipper zip.
Helicalase is similar to a zipper because it can create a series of narrow cuts in DNA. Zipper, on the other hand, uses an accordion-like mechanism to expand and contract along its length.	helicase	Explain how helicase is similar to zipper zip.
Dna replication binding proteins are similar to hands holding open two strips of magnet. The proteins pull the DNA molecules together so that they can be copied by the enzymes in the cell.	dna replication binding proteins	Explain how dna replication binding proteins is similar to hands holding open two strips of magnet.
DNA replication binding proteins are similar to hands holding open two strips of magnet. The DNA replication binding proteins bind to the top and bottom ends of the double-stranded DNA molecule, keeping it close to the nucleotide sequences on each strand so that it can be copied accurately by DNA polymerase.	dna replication binding proteins	Explain how dna replication binding proteins is similar to hands holding open two strips of magnet.
Both proteins bind to specific sites on DNA and cause the strands to unwind. With hands, this movement separates two pieces of metal that form a magnetic field when they are brought close together again (a process called re-galvanization). This allows a current to flow through the magnets and create an image on a device like a film reel or computer monitor.	dna replication binding proteins	Explain how dna replication binding proteins is similar to hands holding open two strips of magnet.
Both proteins use their spatial properties to control the flow of dna. In the case of replication binding proteins, these proteins bind specifically to specific sequences in DNA and help guide the copying process during cell division. In contrast, hands holding open two strips of magnet use their physical forces to interact with one another and keep the magnetic fields aligned so that a current can flow through them.	dna replication binding proteins	Explain how dna replication binding proteins is similar to hands holding open two strips of magnet.

Ligase is a similar to a sewing machine because it uses an enzyme to bind two pieces of DNA together.	ligase	Explain how ligase is similar to sewing machine.
Ligase is similar to a sewing machine in that it breaks the DNA double helix into smaller pieces by using an enzyme called ligase.

Process control blocks store other detailed information about the running programs on your computer, such as their memory usage and communication channels	process control block	Explain how process control block is similar to inode.
Process control blocks (PCB) and inodes are both used to track files and directories. They both have a number of fields that contain information about the file or directory, such as its size, modification time, and read/write permissions.	process control block	Explain how process control block is similar to inode.

Both msg encodings and speaking involve using symbols to represent sounds. In English, "th" is used to represent the sound of "the" and "fl" is used to represent the sound of "fly." In a message encoded in ASCII, the symbol for "th" would be represented by the character 'T' while the symbol for 'fl' would be represented by the character 'F'.	message encoding	Explain how message encoding is similar to speaking.
Both message encoding and speaking are ways of conveying information. In spoken language, we use sounds to create words that together form a sentence or phrase. We do this by activating our vocal cords and producing vibrations that travel through the air and into someone else's ears. These Sounds determine what word is being said based on where it falls in a particular language's grammar structure. Similarly, when we encode a message, we use symbols to represent certain pieces of information. These symbols can be letters, numbers, punctuation marks, or other similar items. Once they have been encoded, they can be processed by the brain in much the same way as speech sounds would be.	message encoding	Explain how message encoding is similar to speaking.
Both message encoding and speaking are ways of communicating with others. Message encoding is the process of converting a spoken message into an electronic format, while speaking is the act of communicating via oral communication.	message encoding	Explain how message encoding is similar to speaking.
Both message encoding and speaking involve transferring information from one entity (the speaker) to another (the listener). In message encoding, the speaker uses symbols or written words to encode their message for the listener. This process can be compared to how a spoken language is encoded into small units of sound that we can understand. As with speech, it is important for the encoder to ensure that their messages are accurately conveyed without distortion. For example, when someone is speaking in a foreign language, they may need to take some time learning how to create the correct sounds in order to produce clear phrases. The same goes for creating an effective message encoding scheme - if not done correctly, the meaning of the message will be lost on those trying to read it.	message encoding	Explain how message encoding is similar to speaking.
Both encoding and speaking involve the use of symbols to communicate information. In message encoding, these symbols are used to represent words or sounds. When we speak, these symbols are translated into speech vibrations by our vocal cords and transmitted through airwaves to those who can understand us.	message encoding	Explain how message encoding is similar to speaking.
Drugs interact with receptor sites in the same way that a key fits into a lock. The specific drug and receptor site combinations determine how powerful the interaction will be. This is why two drugs that interact at one receptor site may not have an effect at another, because they are using different drug/receptor combinations.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain how interaction between drugs and receptor sites is similar to lock and key.
When interacting with receptor sites, drugs and receptors form a complex that can only be unlocked by the correct key. In this analogy, the "keys" are the various drug molecules and their effects on receptor site function; while the "locks" represent how these keys must interact in order to activate or sensitize those receptors.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain how interaction between drugs and receptor sites is similar to lock and key.
Interaction between drugs and receptor sites is similar to lock and key because the molecules that interact with each other have specific shapes, sizes, and concentrations. The molecules must fit together so that their chemical reactions can take place.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain how interaction between drugs and receptor sites is similar to lock and key.
Drugs interact with receptor sites on cells to create a biological response. The interaction is similar to how you might use a key to open a door. Each drug has its own specific lock, and when it interacts with the receptor site, it causes the door to unlock. Once the door is unlocked, drugs can enter the cell and cause their desired biological effect.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain how interaction between drugs and receptor sites is similar to lock and key.
Interaction between drugs and receptor sites is similar to how a lock and key work. The drug binds to the receptor site, which locks the drug in place so that it can't escape. This prevents the drug from interacting with other molecules, which would then cause a reaction.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain how interaction between drugs and receptor sites is similar to lock and key.
Foot fitting is similar to drug interactions with receptor sites in that they are both situations where two different things come together and the outcome of that interaction affects something else. In foot fitting, a person's feet are measured and then a pair of shoes/boots designed specifically for their size is created. The same thing happens with drugs - receptor sites are identified on the surface of cells and then drugs that interact with those receptors are developed.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain how interaction between drugs and receptor sites is similar to foot fitting in footprint.
Foot fitting in footprints is similar to how drugs interact with receptor sites. Drugs attach to specific receptor sites on the cell membrane, which causes a change in the way that the cell works. The same thing happens when we take drugs and interact with receptors on our cells - this changes the way that they work.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain how interaction between drugs and receptor sites is similar to foot fitting in footprint.
Foot fitting is similar to drug interaction at receptor sites because foot fitting helps the shoe fit snugly around your feet, just as drugs interact with receptor sites to produce a desired effect. For example, shoes with a narrow width help to align the bones in your feet more closely together, while wider shoes can distribute pressure more evenly across all of your toes. Similarly, some medications work best when taken immediately after meals to allow their nutrients to reach their receptors and carry out their effects most effectively.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain how interaction between drugs and receptor sites is similar to foot fitting in footprint.
The interaction between drugs and receptor sites is similar to foot fitting in footprint. When a person wears shoes, their feet fit into the pattern on the bottom of the shoe. This fit determines how comfortable and effective the shoes are. The same process happens when a drug interacts with receptor sites. Drugs that interact with specific receptors will have different effects based on which receptors they bind to.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain how interaction between drugs and receptor sites is similar to foot fitting in footprint.
There is not a lot of similarity between the two situations. The way drugs interact with receptor sites is by attaching themselves to the receptor and then initiating a response in the cell. This response can be anything from causing the cell to fire, which leads to an effect on overall function, all the way down to merely altering gene expression. When looking at foot fitting, it is typically done by someone who has some experience in footwear design or engineering coming into contact with your feet directly (through socks or shoes), measuring them using special instruments, and trying to create a custom fit for you.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Explain how interaction between drugs and receptor sites is similar to foot fitting in footprint.

Both tree and coral have a calcareous skeleton that is composed of tiny crystals. Over time, these crystals will break down and release calcium into the water around them. This process can be measured and used to calculate how old the organism is.	tree's age calculation	Explain how tree's age calculation is similar to coral's age calculation.
Both tree and coral can measure their age by counting the number of years since they were born. For tree's age, you would take the total time it has been alive (counting from when it was planted), minus any deaths due to natural causes (a lightning strike, for example) or human-caused events (a hurricane). Corals can also count back how long it has taken for them to reproduce using a process called annual growth rings.	tree's age calculation	Explain how tree's age calculation is similar to coral's age calculation.
Both tree's age calculation and coral's age calculation involve counting the number of years since a particular event. In tree's case, this is counting back from when an individual tree was planted or grew in its current location. Coral's case involves measuring how many calcium carbonate "growth rings" are present on the coral organism.	tree's age calculation	Explain how tree's age calculation is similar to coral's age calculation.
Both tree and coral can calculate their age from the number of years since they were born. Coral's calculation is based on how long it takes for new tissue to replace old tissue; in other words, how fast it grows.

Both tree and coral grow through the years by accumulating new cells. Coral can also secrete substances that help it regenerate lost tissue, while a tree's growth is limited primarily by its ability to absorb water and nutrients from the soil.

Both involve a series of ups and downs. In roller coaster, the hills make you feel exhilarated as you race up them, only to be blasted down the other side by a steep drop.

Anti-stokes scattering is the process of a projectile impacting an object and bouncing off in many directions. This occurs because the energy that is put into moving the projectile away from its original location, (such as when you throw a ball), doesn't quite have time to dissipate evenly throughout the entire object. Rather than hitting one point on the surface and transferring all of its energy there, it ricochets around internally until it eventually comes to rest.	anti-stokes scattering	Explain how anti-stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate.
The way that anti-stokes scattering works is just like how ball striking a plate works. The baseball hits the plate, and then the energy from the hit travels through the air to the plate, and it causes vibration in the air around it. This vibration creates tiny particles called plasma that are created when high-energy electrons and protons collide. These particles move away from each other faster than they can travel straight forward, so they scatter off of things in their path (like the surface of a baseball).	anti-stokes scattering	Explain how anti-stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate.
When a ball is struck by the bat, it makes an impact with the front of the baseball on either side. This creates vibrations in the air that travel to our ears and are heard as sound. These vibrations also create ripples in water that we see as waves. Similarly, when anti-stokes scattering happens, particles hit each other and cause light to be scattered in all directions.	anti-stokes scattering	Explain how anti-stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate.
The two phenomena are similar in that they involve the interaction of a particle, typically a ball or an anti-stokes particle, with a surface. In ball striking, the object collides with the plate and causes waves to travel outward from the impact point. These waves cause particles near the impact point to be scattered in all directions. Similarly, in anti-stokes scattering, droplets or other small objects are dispersed by acoustic waves thattravel outwards from their original location	anti-stokes scattering	Explain how anti-stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate.
Anti-stokes scattering is a process that eliminates the direct impact between the ball and the plate. Instead, it generates flashes of light as they clash against each other. This happens because air molecules in front of and around the ball are disrupted by its impact, which then causes photons to scatter in all directions. In ball striking a plate, these scattered photons hit our eyes and create an image onscreen.	anti-stokes scattering	Explain how anti-stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate.
Both ball striking and stokes scattering occur when a object (ball, strike) impacts an uneven surface (plate). In both cases, the energy of the impact is spread out over a larger area than if the impact had occurred against a smooth surface. This results in more strikes that are close to each other on the plate compared to those that would have struck against a smooth surface.	stokes scattering	Explain how stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate.
Both stokes scattering and ball striking a plate involve the transfer of energy from an object to another. In ball striking, the energy is transferred from the baseball to the batting surface. In stokes scattering, the energy is transferred from particles in hot gas to surfaces nearby.	stokes scattering	Explain how stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate.
When a ball is hit by the hand, it causes stokes scattering. The ball creates tiny vibrations as it travels through the air and these vibrations cause different areas of the ball to vibrate at different frequencies. The higher frequency vibration spreads out from the center of the ball more than the lower frequency vibration, so when the ball makes contact with a surface like a plate or net, some parts of it will strike first and others will strike later.	stokes scattering	Explain how stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate.
Stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate because the stokes particles are randomly scattered in all directions. This means that there is more variation in how far each stoke particle travels compared to when a baseball strikes a plate, which leads to more edges being hit and less of a consistent strike zone.	stokes scattering	Explain how stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate.
Both stokes scattering and ball striking a plate create a small collision between the object and the surface. This collision results in energy being released, which is why both activities produce sound. The primary difference between these collisions is that while ball striking occurs when an object collides with a plane surface, stokes scattering takes place when an object impacts one or more waves of gas molecules.	stokes scattering	Explain how stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate.
Median lethal dose and balls and target are both ways of measuring how much a substance can kill a person. They differ in that median lethal dose is measured over a group of people, while balls and target measure the amount of poison that will kill one person out of every 10.	median lethal dose	Explain how median lethal dose is similar to balls and target.
A median lethal dose is similar to a balls and target. It is a method of calculating the dose that will kill half of the test subjects, or 50% of the population.	median lethal dose	Explain how median lethal dose is similar to balls and target.
The median lethal dose is a measure of the amount of a substance that can kill half of the people who consume it. The balls and target analogy compares the median lethal dose to an imaginary target at which 50% of shots would hit, given enough shootings.	median lethal dose	Explain how median lethal dose is similar to balls and target.
The median lethal dose (LD50) is the dose of a substance that, when administered to 50% of the population, will kill half of those who receive it. This definition is similar to the idea behind the target model - in both models, you are looking for an "average" response from a group of people. The balls and target model uses round objects to represent individuals, while the median lethal dose model uses numerical values.	median lethal dose	Explain how median lethal dose is similar to balls and target.
Median lethal dose (MLD) is the dose that kills half of a population. Balls and target are two ways to measure how harmful something is.	median lethal dose	Explain how median lethal dose is similar to balls and target.

Both universe and the surface of a balloon are filled with gas. In the case of a balloon, this gas is helium. The pressure inside the balloon causes the gas to be compressed so tightly that it forms a thin film on top of the liquid air beneath. This film is held up by tiny air molecules that are forced close together by the pressure. If we removed all of the air from around a penny, for example, some of these same forces would cause it to flatten out like an accordion or even curl into a circle!	universe	Explain how universe is similar to surface of a balloon.

Enzyme mechanism is similar to lock and key because they are both a type of physical system where items work together in order to create an effect. In the case of enzyme mechanism, the items are enzymes and their substrate molecules, while in the case of locks and keys, the items are metal pieces that can be used to open or close a door. Both systems require two components in order for them to function: one that catalyzes (enables) the activity of the other, and another which is acted upon (substrates).	enzyme mechanism	Explain how enzyme mechanism is similar to lock and key.
Enzyme mechanism is similar to lock and key. In both cases, the mechanism utilizes two components: an enzyme and a substrate. The enzyme binds to the substrate, which then causes a change in chemical structure. This new structural configuration locks the reactants together so that they can't form another molecule of product until the original substrate is released by the enzymatic activity	enzyme mechanism	Explain how enzyme mechanism is similar to lock and key.
Enzymes are similar to locks and keys because they both consist of two pieces that fit together. The lock piece is shaped like a key, while the enzyme piece is shaped like a door. When these pieces go together, the enzyme can do its job of breaking down food.	enzyme mechanism	Explain how enzyme mechanism is similar to lock and key.
Enzyme mechanism is similar to lock and key because enzymes are proteins that catalyze chemical reactions in the body. The protein has a specific shape, which allows it to fit into certain spots on the substrate molecule. This binding activates the enzyme, allowing it to catalyze the reaction.	enzyme mechanism	Explain how enzyme mechanism is similar to lock and key.
Anova is a statistical technique that helps to identify which treatment or experiment has the most effect. It does this by analyzing data in order to determine whether there are differences between groups with regard to certain variables. This can be done, for example, by comparing the results of two different treatments on a given variable (such as patients' overall health after receiving a particular type of chemotherapy). If there are any significant differences between groups, then it may be concluded that one treatment was more effective than the other.	anova	Explain how anova is similar to finding signal in the noise.

Anova is a statistic that helps researchers understand the relationship between two variables. The difference between anova and finding signal in noise is that when scientists look for signal in noise, they are specifically looking for patterns or correlations that exist among different sets of data. In contrast, anova is used to compare multiple groups of data (strata) and determine whether there are differences in their means.	anova	Explain how anova is similar to finding signal in the noise.
Anova is a design of experiment that can help in the analysis of data. It helps to identify differences between groups or treatments and it also allows for statistical comparisons among multiple experimental conditions.

The equilibrium concentration of a chemical in solution is the same as the total amount of that chemical present divided by the volume of solution. In dam and lake situations, water levels are controlled so that there is always an equal number of cells filled with water from the upstream side to downstream side. If more water were allowed to flow downslope then it would cause river levels to rise above where they should be, causing backflow (water going upstream), while if less water was allowed to flow downslope then reservoir levels would fall below desired limits, resulting in flooding (widespread release of stored water). Conversely, if too much rain or snowfall was dumped into a watershed quickly enough then everything would start overflowing because there wouldn't be enough time for all the excess runoff to percolate through soils and reach streams and rivers - this is called "flash flooding".	chemical equilibrium	Explain how chemical equilibrium is similar to water level in dam and lake.
Chemical equilibrium is similar to water level in dam and lake because both are controlled by the flow of liquids. In a dam, the engineers control how much water flows out and over the edge of the Dam while at a lake, the natural laws governing riverflow continuously distribute water levels among its various basin areas.	chemical equilibrium	Explain how chemical equilibrium is similar to water level in dam and lake.
The chemical equilibrium in a dam and a lake are similar because the water level is regulated by the flow of water.	chemical equilibrium	Explain how chemical equilibrium is similar to water level in dam and lake.
Water level in dam and lake are both controlled by the equilibrium of two opposing forces: gravity and buoyancy. In a dam, water is forced up the sloping sides by gravity until it reaches the top where it spills over into the basin below. As more water filters its way down through the soil and rocks to fill up this new reservoir, it displaces air (buoyancy) that was previously pushing against the water's surface. This balancing act keeps our lakes at about a constant depth despite changes in rainfall or snow melt runoff.	chemical equilibrium	Explain how chemical equilibrium is similar to water level in dam and lake.
Chemical equilibrium is a state in which the total concentration of all chemical species remains constant. In water level analogy, this means that the height of the water in a dam or lake stays roughly constant even as more or less water flows into or out of it.	chemical equilibrium	Explain how chemical equilibrium is similar to water level in dam and lake.
Just-in-time manufacturing is similar to water and rocks in that it helps us stay organized and efficient. Just-in-time can help us avoid overproduction, which can lead to wastefulness and cost overruns. Similarly, water flows downhill and rock powder makes good building materials because they are stable under pressure and don't react with other substances.	just-in-time	Explain how just-in-time is similar to water and rocks.
Just-in-time is a manufacturing process in which items are produced as needed instead of being manufactured beforehand and stored. This contrasts with the standard production model, in which products are made in advance and stored until they're required. Just-in-time also differs from water because while water can be manipulated to flow where it's needed, just-in-time requires strict planning and coordination among myriad parties involved in its production. Finally, just-in time compares unfavorably to rocks when it comes to durability—rock formations will last much longer than objects created through the just-in-time process.	just-in-time	Explain how just-in-time is similar to water and rocks.

Police headquerters are similar to adaptive immunity in that they both rely on the immune system to recognize and destroy foreign objects or organisms. However, police headquerters involve officers entering a home without permission or legitimate reason, whereas adaptive immunity happens naturally when the body's cells encounter an antigen.	adaptive immunity	Explain how adaptive immunity is similar to police headquerters.
Adaptive immunity is similar to police headquerters because adaptive immunity protects the body from invaders by identifying them and destroying them. In contrast, police headquerters are law enforcement officers who use their powers to forcefully enter homes without justification.	adaptive immunity	Explain how adaptive immunity is similar to police headquerters.
Ohm's law is similar to the three animals in that they are all considered to be power generators.

Electric circuit is similar to air flowing through a tube in that an electric current flows through the circuit. The flow of electricity carries energy from one point to another. In an electric circuit, materials are used to create barriers or paths for the current, and these materials can be metal wires, pieces of plastic, or even thin sheets of paper. When a voltage is applied across the two ends of the wire (or between the metal plates in a transformer), electrons move freely through the material and out into the environment	electric circuit	Explain how electric circuit is similar to air flowing through a tube.
Electric circuits are similar to air flowing through a tube in that they both have an upstream and downstream portion. Additionally, electric currents flow through the circuit while air flows throughout thetube. The major difference between electric circuits and air flowing through a tube is that electric current can pass only one way down an electric circuit whereas air can circulate around inside a tube.	electric circuit	Explain how electric circuit is similar to air flowing through a tube.
Electric circuits are similar to air flowing through a tube in several ways. First, electric currents move along the surface of an electrode like water moving through a pipe. Second, when electricity passes through something else (like air), it creates heat because it is breaking down molecules into their component atoms and electrons. Third, electric fields help propagate electric current throughout a circuit. Finally, tubes create pressure differences between the inside and outside due to the flow of gas, which pushes objects against the walls of the tube.	electric circuit	Explain how electric circuit is similar to air flowing through a tube.
Electric circuit is similar to air flowing through a tube in that electric current flows from the positive terminal of one battery to the negative terminal of another, creating an electrical forcefield. The difference between electric and air flow is that with fluid motion, physical objects such as tubes or pipes carry the fluid while it moves along them. With electricity, however, no material object carries the current; instead, currents are created by alternating connections between two pieces of metal (usually), which creates a magnetic field around each wire.	electric circuit	Explain how electric circuit is similar to air flowing through a tube.
An electric circuit is similar to air flowing through a tube in that current flows along the length of the conductor. The difference between an electric circuit and air flowing through a tube is that currents in an electric circuit flow continuously, while air moves only when it's pushed or pulled by something else.	electric circuit	Explain how electric circuit is similar to air flowing through a tube.

Both hydrophobic and teenagers at a party are perceived as being out of their element.	hydrophobic effect	Explain how hydrophobic effect is similar to teenagers at a party.
Both hydrophobic effect and teenagers at a party are examples of situations where things tend to avoid contact with one another. Hydrophobic effect is caused by molecules having an outer shell that is highly resistant to being soaked up by water, while teenagers at a party are typically more interested in avoiding social interaction than they are in soaking up water.	hydrophobic effect	Explain how hydrophobic effect is similar to teenagers at a party.
Both hydrophobic and teenagers at a party are surrounded by water. Hydrophobic substances are not as wet as water and do not move around as much, which makes them seem scary or like they might make trouble. Teens at a party also tend to be more social and active than hydrophobic substances	hydrophobic effect	Explain how hydrophobic effect is similar to teenagers at a party.
Both hydrophobic effect and teenagers at a party are phenomena in which an entity is repelled by water. Hydrophobic effect occurs when small, soluble molecules are concentrated near the surface of a liquid or gel where they can interact with each other more easily than they can with larger particles. This phenomenon makes these molecules difficult for liquids or gels to penetrate, leading them to be retained on surfaces rather than transported through them. Teenagers at a party occur when adolescents who are physiologically active (e.g., jumping around) expel large amounts of sweat and sebum from their pores, resulting in a higher concentration of oil and moisture on their skin compared to adults. Both situations cause individuals to be attracted to opposite ends of the spectrum: substances that will dissolve away oils and moisturize skin (hydrogenated vegetable oil), versus substances that attract dust and dirt (coconut oil).	hydrophobic effect	Explain how hydrophobic effect is similar to teenagers at a party.
Both are things that some people may feel uncomfortable around.	hydrophobic effect	Explain how hydrophobic effect is similar to teenagers at a party.
Both biological signal transduction and threat communication involve the exchange of information between cells in order to coordinate an appropriate response. Biological signal transduction occurs when a receptor protein on one cell binds to a chemical messenger molecule released by another cell, initiating a series of biochemical reactions that result in the altering or regulation of cellular activity. Threat communication involves the transmission of signals from one animal to another as part of an attempt to elicit a desired behavior or avoid unwanted aggression. In both cases, the goal is often deterrence - ensuring that all parties involved are aware of potential threats and take steps to minimize their likelihood or impact.	biological signal transduction	Explain how biological signal transduction is similar to threat communication in animals.
Both biological signal transduction and threat communication involve the transmission of information from one individual to another. Threat communication, however, is often used as a way to induce fear in another animal.

Threat communication is generally used when an animal feels threatened, while biological signal transduction is used for a variety of purposes including regulating stress levels, controlling heart rate, and generating blood flow.	biological signal transduction	Explain how biological signal transduction is similar to threat communication in animals.
Biological signal transduction involves the transfer of signals between cells in order to control or regulate physiological responses. Threat communication is a similar process used by animals in order to communicate risks and deter threats. Both processes involve the use of different types of signals, which are then transferred through the nervous system to elicit specific responses.	biological signal transduction	Explain how biological signal transduction is similar to threat communication in animals.
In both biological signal transduction and threat communication, an animal is trying to send a message to another animal in order to achieve some goal. The main difference between the two types of communication is that threat communication usually involves using physical aggression (e.g., biting) in order to gain control over the other animal. Biological signal transduction, on the other hand, typically occurs without any violence or aggression involved.	biological signal transduction	Explain how biological signal transduction is similar to threat communication in animals.
